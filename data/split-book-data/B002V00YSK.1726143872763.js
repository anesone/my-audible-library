window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Don’t miss <i>Bridge of Clay</i>, Markus Zusak’s first novel since <i>The Book Thief</i>. </p> <p>The extraordinary number-one <i>New York Times</i> best seller that is now a major motion picture, Markus Zusak's unforgettable story is about the ability of books to feed the soul. Nominated as one of America's best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read. </p> <p>When Death has a story to tell, you listen. It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will become busier still. Liesel Meminger is a foster girl living outside of Munich, who scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can’t resist - books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement. </p> <p>In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak, author of <i>I Am the Messenger</i>, has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time. </p> <p>“The kind of book that can be life-changing.” (<i>The New York Times</i>) </p> <p>“Deserves a place on the same shelf with T<i>he Diary of a Young Girl </i>by Anne Frank.” (<i>USA Today</i>)</p>";
