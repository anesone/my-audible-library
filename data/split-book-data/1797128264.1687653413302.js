window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Mitch Rapp, the CIA’s top operative, searches for a high-level mole with the power to rewrite the world order in this riveting thriller from number one </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author Vince Flynn, written by Kyle Mills.</b></p> <p>Mitch Rapp has worked for a number of presidents over his career, but Anthony Cook is unlike any he’s encountered before. Cunning and autocratic, he feels no loyalty to America’s institutions and is distrustful of the influence Rapp and CIA director Irene Kennedy have in Washington.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Kennedy discovers evidence of a mole scouring the Agency’s database for sensitive information on Nicholas Ward, the world’s first trillionaire, she assigns Rapp the task of protecting him. In doing so, he finds himself walking an impossible tightrope: Keep the man alive, but also use him as bait to uncover a traitor who has seemingly unlimited access to government secrets.</p> <p>As the attacks on Ward become increasingly dire, Rapp and Kennedy are dragged into a world where the lines between governments, multinational corporations, and the hyper-wealthy fade. An environment in which liberty, nationality, and loyalty are meaningless. Only the pursuit of power remains.</p> <p>As “one of the best thriller writers on the planet” (<i>The Real Book Spy</i>), Kyle Mills has created another suspenseful read that not only echoes the America of today, but also offers a glimpse into its possible future.</p>";
