window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sixteen-year-old Blake has always been the responsible one in his dysfunctional family - the one who drives safely, gets good grades, and looks after his wild younger brother, Quinn. Quinn is his brother's opposite - a thrill-seeker who's always chasing the next scary rush, no matter what the cost. But Quinn and Blake are in for the surprise of their lives when they're thrust into the world of a bizarre phantom carnival - and their souls are the price of admission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In order to save his brother, and himself, Blake must survive seven different carnival rides before dawn. Seven rides; it sounds easy. But each ride is full of unexpected dangers, because each ride is a reflection of one of Blake's deepest fears. And the last ride is the worst one of all. That's the one that confronts Blake with a terrifying secret from his past - a secret he's been running from for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Full of roller-coaster twists and turns, Neal Shusterman's latest novel is an Orpheus-like adventure into one boy's psyche.</p>";
