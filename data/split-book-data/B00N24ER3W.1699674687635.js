The bait is the Spektor decoding machine, which is to be delivered by the irresistible Tatiana Romanova. The assassin is Red Grant, a psychopath who has defected from the West. Bond and Tatiana become pawns in a game of cross and double-cross that reaches its deadly finale on the Orient Express. </p> <p>This audiobook includes a bonus interview with Toby Stephens. </p> <p>Blackstone Audio, Inc.
