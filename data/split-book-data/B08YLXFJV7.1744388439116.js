window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They are priceless, multifaceted jewels of misjudgment. Masterworks of the moronic. Steroid-juiced stupidity wearing a size 9XX dunce cap embroidered with one simple word: “Duh”.</p> <p>They are the colossally, often laughably bad notions that have leapt from the short-circuiting synapses of some of the world’s brightest (and dimmest) brains, then faithfully chronicled here in 100 of the Worst Ideas in History.</p> <p>On this rollicking romp through the bungles and stumbles of the distant and recent past, we’ll meet the US President who starts each day skinny-dipping in the Potomac. Drink in the dental hygiene product that actually rots your teeth. Get an earful of the hit singing group that can’t really sing. Meet the confused chauffeur who helped start a world war. Munch on the tasty new snack food that might just give you diarrhea. Review a dozen of the worst movies ever committed to celluloid. Plus so much more (of so much less). </p> <p>Prescribing a double shot of Clorox to kill a viral infection? That’s a run-of-the-mill noggin-scratcher compared to these stupendously stinky ideas - ones that have started wars, sunk countries, wrecked companies, scuttled careers, lost millions, endangered the Earth and left the bad idea’s mommy or daddy as red-faced as, well, your mom or dad will be when they learn that you like to dress your pit bull as one of the Backstreet Boys.</p> <p>It's all here for your listening pleasure: The magical, musical, audiobook <i>100 of the Worst Ideas in History</i>. (Void if inhibited. Batteries not included. Action figures sold separately. Your mileage may vary. If excitement last more than four hours, please consult your psychiatrist).</p>";
