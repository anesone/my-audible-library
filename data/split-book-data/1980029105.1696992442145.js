window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the most influential works of this century, <i>The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays</i> is a crucial exposition of existentialist thought. Influenced by works such as Don Juan and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide; the question of living or not living in a universe devoid of order or meaning.&nbsp;</p> <p>With lyric eloquence, Albert Camus brilliantly posits a way out of despair, reaffirming the value of personal existence and the possibility of life lived with dignity and authenticity.</p>";
