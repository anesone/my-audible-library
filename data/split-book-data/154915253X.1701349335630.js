window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In an audiobook that is </b><b><i>The Big Sick </i></b><b>meets </b><b><i>Dad Is Fat</i></b><b>, Jeannie Gaffigan, writer/director/producer/accused supermom and wife of best-selling author/comedian Jim Gaffigan, writes with humor and heart about the pear-sized brain tumor she had removed, the toll it took on her enormous family, and the priceless lessons she learned along the way. </b></p> <p>In 2017, Jeannie's life came to a crashing halt when she was diagnosed with a life-threatening brain tumor. As the mother of five kids - six if you include her husband - sat in the neurosurgery department in star-covered sweats too whimsical for the seriousness of the situation, all she could think was, \"Am I going to die?\"&nbsp;</p> <p>Thankfully, Jeannie and her family were able to survive their time of crisis, and now she is sharing her deeply personal journey through this miraculous story: the challenging conversations she had with her children; how she came to terms with feeling powerless and ferociously crabby while bedridden and unable to eat for a month; and how she ultimately learned, re-learned, and re-re-learned to be more present in life.&nbsp;</p> <p>With sincerity and hilarity, Jeannie invites you into her heart (and brain) during this trying time, emphasizing the importance of family, faith, and humor as keys to her recovery and leading a more fulfilling life.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
