window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Sometimes I just let my children fall asleep in front of the TV.</i> </p> <p>In a culture that idealizes motherhood, it’s scary to confess that, in your house, being a mother is beautiful and dirty and joyful and frustrating all at once. Admitting that it’s not easy doesn’t make you a bad mom; at least, it shouldn’t. </p> <p><i>If I can’t survive my daughter as a toddler, how the hell am I going to get through the teenage years?</i> </p> <p>When Jill Smokler was first home with her small children, she thought her blog would be something to keep friends and family updated. To her surprise, she hit a chord in the hearts of mothers everywhere. </p> <p><i>I end up doing my son’s homework. It’s wrong, but so much easier.</i> </p> <p>Total strangers were contributing their views on that strange reality called motherhood. As other women shared their stories, Jill realized she wasn’t alone in her feelings of exhaustion and imperfection. </p> <p><i>My eighteen month old still can’t say “Mommy” but used the word “shit” in perfect context.</i> </p> <p>But she sensed her readers were still holding back, so decided to start an anonymous confessional, a place where real moms could leave their most honest thoughts without fearing condemnation. </p> <p><i>I pretend to be happy but I cry every night in the shower.</i> </p> <p>The reactions were amazing: some sad, some pee-in-your-pants funny, some brutally honest. But they were real, not a commercial glamorization. </p> <p><i>I clock out of motherhood at 8 P.M. and hide in the basement with my laptop and a beer.</i> </p> <p>If you’re already a fan, lock the bathroom door on your whining kids, run a bubble bath, and settle in. If you’ve not encountered Scary Mommy before, break out a glass of champagne as well, because you’ll be toasting your initiation into a select club. </p> <p><i>I know why some animals eat their young.</i> </p> <p>In chapters that cover husbands (\"The Biggest Baby of Them All\") to homework (\"Didn’t I Already Graduate?\"), <i>Confessions of a Scary Mommy</i> combines all-new essays from Jill with the best of the anonymous confessions. </p> <p><i>Sometimes I wish my son was still little - then I hear kids screaming at the store.</i> </p> <p>As Jill says, “We like to paint motherhood as picture perfect. A newborn peacefully resting on his mother’s chest. A toddler taking tentative first steps into his mother’s loving arms. A mother fluffing her daughter’s prom dress. These moments are indeed miraculous and joyful; they can also be few and far between.”</p>";
