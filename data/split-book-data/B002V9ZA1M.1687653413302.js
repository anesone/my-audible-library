Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, she has endured a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife to reach the ultimate turning point.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fate of two tribes hangs.</p> <p>Now Bella has made her decision; a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating and unfathomable consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life - first discovered in <i>Twilight</i>, then scattered and torn in <i>New Moon</i> and <i>Eclipse</i> - seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed...forever?</p> <p>The astonishing, breathlessly anticipated conclusion to the Twilight Saga, <i>Breaking Dawn</i> illuminates the secrets and mysteries of this spellbinding romantic epic.</p>";
