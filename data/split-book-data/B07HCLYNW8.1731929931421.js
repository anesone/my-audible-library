window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the award-winning author of </b><b><i>The Triumph of Seeds</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Feathers</i></b><b>, a natural and cultural history of the buzzing wee beasties that make the world go round. </b></p> <p>Bees are like oxygen: ubiquitous, essential, and, for the most part, unseen. While we might overlook them, they lie at the heart of relationships that bind the human and natural worlds. In <i>Buzz</i>, the beloved Thor Hanson takes us on a journey that begins 125 million years ago, when a wasp first dared to feed pollen to its young. From honeybees and bumbles to lesser-known diggers, miners, leafcutters, and masons, bees have long been central to our harvests, our mythologies, and our very existence. They've given us sweetness and light, the beauty of flowers, and as much as a third of the foodstuffs we eat. And, alarmingly, they are at risk of disappearing. </p> <p>As informative and enchanting as the waggle dance of a honeybee, <i>Buzz </i>shows us why all bees are wonders to celebrate and protect. Listen to this book and you'll never overlook them again.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";
