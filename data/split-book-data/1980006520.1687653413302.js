window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The eighth novel in James S. A. Corey's&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling Expanse series - now a major television series.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thirteen hundred gates have opened to solar systems around the galaxy. But as humanity builds its interstellar empire in the alien ruins, the mysteries and threats grow deeper.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the dead systems where gates lead to stranger things than alien planets, Elvi Okoye begins a desperate search to discover the nature of a genocide that happened before the first human beings existed and to find weapons to fight a war against forces at the edge of the imaginable. But the price of that knowledge may be higher than she can pay.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the heart of the empire, Teresa Duarte prepares to take on the burden of her father's godlike ambition. The sociopathic scientist Paolo Cort√°zar and the Mephistophelian prisoner James Holden are only two of the dangers in a palace thick with intrigue, but Teresa has a mind of her own and secrets even her father, the emperor, doesn't guess.&nbsp;</p> <p>And throughout the wide human empire, the scattered crew of the&nbsp;Rocinante&nbsp;fights a brave rear-guard action against Duarte's authoritarian regime.&nbsp;</p> <p>Memory of the old order falls away, and a future under Laconia's eternal rule - and with it, a battle that humanity can only lose - seems more and more certain. Because against the terrors that lie between worlds, courage and ambition will not be enough....</p>";
