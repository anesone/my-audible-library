window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For millennia, fresh olive oil has been a necessity - for food, medicine, beauty, and religion. Today's researchers continue to confirm the remarkable, life-giving properties of true extra-virgin, and \"extra-virgin Italian\" has become the highest standard of quality. But what if this symbol of purity has become deeply corrupt? </p> <p>Starting with an explosive article in <i>The New Yorker</i>, Tom Mueller has become the world's expert on olive oil and olive oil fraud - a story of globalization, deception, and crime from ancient times to the present, and a powerful indictment of today's lax protections against fake and even toxic food products in the United States. <i>Extra Virginity</i> is an inspiring account of the people who are defending the extraordinary oils that truly deserve the name \"extra-virgin\".</p>";
