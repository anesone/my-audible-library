window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>2024 Audie Award winner for Audio Drama</b></p> <p>Get ready for a hilarious fantasy adventure crafted by master storyteller Felicia Day. This epic and captivating audio experience is performed by an incredible ensemble cast including Felicia herself, Wil Wheaton, Sean Astin, LilyPichu, London Hughes, and the incomparable Neil Gaiman as The Narrator.</p> <p>Once upon a time, in the magical land of San Francisco, there lived a not-so-ordinary girl named Laurel Pettigrew. She was supposed to be the Chosen One. The plan was simple: She would vanquish the great evil Tybus in an epic battle. But destiny had other ideas, and Laurel's performance in the whole heroics department was a colossal flop.</p> <p>Now, instead of being a legendary hero, Laurel's the resident pariah of the magic realm. And what’s worse, the dark wizard Tybus swooped in, took over the realm, and forced all supernatural creatures to live under his tyrannical rule. He’s even stripped away the magical powers of those who refused to join his wicked cause. Yeah, everyone hates her. Well, everyone except her two roomies—Sybil, the sassiest diva of a fairy, who could throw shade with the flick of a wing. And Frank, the vampire who rocks a bald spot and a serious paunch. They are the real MVPs, the ride-or-die buddies who have her back, no matter how many colossal fails she racks up.</p> <p>And it’s all about to get even weirder. Along comes Kate, a Normie who somehow knows more about Laurel than Laurel knows about herself. Turns out, she's got some secrets up her sleeve that might just give Laurel a shot at redemption and a chance to rewrite her destiny.</p> <p><i>Third Eye</i> is a side-splitting adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Laurel and her ragtag team of misfits must embark on a wild journey to take down Tybus. It's a treacherous path, but they'll have to put their differences aside and work together. Get ready to laugh, gasp, and cheer as they stumble their way toward an epic showdown.</p> <p>The full cast includes Felicia Day, Neil Gaiman, Christopher Judge, Carolyn Seymour, Laraine Newman, Wil Wheaton, Danny Pudi, Sean Astin, LilyPichu, London Hughes, Alan Tudyk, Nyima Funk, Hudson Yang, Amir Talai, Sean Giambrone, Jade Hykush, Janet Varney, Lila Sage Bromley, Amy Okuda, Phil LaMarr, Steve Agee, Kate Miccuci, Jeff Lewis, Troy Baker, Harvey Guillen, Weird Al Yankovic, Kristian Nairn, and Jonah Ray Rodrigues.</p>";
