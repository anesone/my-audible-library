Lying in wait for millions of years, this species continued to evolve, patiently crossing over and manipulating the genetic code of different species. And now, this perfect omniscient being...born from oblivion has awakened and is ready to feed....</p> <p>God no longer rules supreme.... <i>It's coming.</i></p> <p>American Ted Lazaris is an Amazon best-selling author with&nbsp;seven&nbsp;best sellers to his name, so far.

I have always struggled with the problem. In school, it was always terribly difficult for me to read what was right in front of me. And reading, writing, and spelling still to this day remain difficult for me. One thing I've learned despite having this learning disability is that I can accomplish my goals if I don't get overwhelmed by the big picture. I just take one step at a time.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>DragonMan: Face of the Unknown</i>, authored by Ted Lazaris who created DragonMan and wrote the series of novels which are being developed and produced by ThunderBall Films, has accomplished the amazing feat of debuting at number one on Amazon, ahead of David Baldacci and James Patterson novels.

DragonMan Projects In Development. Screenplays are written by Ted Lazaris and adapted from his published novels by the same names. DragonMan is based on the series of published novels written by, and the original characters created by, Ted Lazaris - Freelance Writing Organization International (FWO-Int'l) member.<br> &nbsp;</p>";
