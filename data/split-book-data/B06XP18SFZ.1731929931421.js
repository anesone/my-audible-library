window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ellen Ripley finally returns to Earth, only to discover that LV-426 — where the crew of the <i>Nostromo</i> first came into contact with the deadly xenomorphs — has been renamed Acheron. </p> <p>Protected by Colonial Marines, the colonists seek to terraform the storm-swept planet against all the odds. But in the face of brutal living conditions and the daily struggles of a new world, there is humanity and hope. Anne and Russell Jorden — two colonists who are seeking a fortune that eluded them on Earth — are expecting their firstborn child. </p> <p>The birth of Rebecca Jorden, known to her family as Newt, is a cause for celebration. But as the colony grows and expands, so, too, do the political struggles between a small detachment of Colonial Marines and the Weyland-Yutani scientists posted on Acheron. Willing to overlook their orders in order to serve the Company's interests, these scientists have another far more sinister agenda — to covertly capture a living Alien. </p> <p>The wildcatters discover a vast, decaying spaceship. The horseshoe-shaped vessel is of particular interest to Weyland-Yutani and may be the answer to their dreams. But what Anne and Russell find onboard proves to be the stuff not of dreams but of nightmares. </p> <p>This terrifying, cinematic, multicast dramatization — directed by the multiaward-winning Dirk Maggs, best known for his adaptations of Douglas Adams' <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> and Neil Gaiman's <i>Neverwhere</i> for the BBC — is the sequel to Audible Original's <i>Alien: Out of the Shadows</i> (nominated for Best Audio Drama at the 2017 Audies). </p> <p>Starring Golden Globe-nominated Anna Friel (<i>Pushing Daisies</i>, <i>Limitless</i>), Alexander Siddig (<i>Star Trek: Deep Space 9</i>, <i>Game of Thrones</i>), Michelle Ryan (<i>Bionic Woman</i>, <i>Doctor Who</i>), Colin Salmon (<i>Alien vs Predator</i>, <i>Arrow</i>, James Bond), Marc Warren (<i>Mad Dogs</i>, <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, <i>Hustle</i>) and Philip Glenister (<i>Outcast</i>, <i>Life on Mars</i>), with special guest star William Hope returning as Lt. Gorman from James Cameron's <i>Aliens</i>. </p>";
