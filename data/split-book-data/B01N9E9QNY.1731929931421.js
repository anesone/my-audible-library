window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here at Audible, we know just how much of an impact a voice can have on a story - taking simple words and filling them with elation, wonderment, tragedy, or pure satisfaction. We rely on our narrators every day to bring our favorite stories and characters to life - to introduce us to new authors and genres, or even to a new (perhaps longer) commute. And though our narrators are the best story tellers in the business, it's usually someone else's that they're telling. </p><p>This holiday season, as our gift to you, we asked 19 beloved performers to share their own personal holiday memories. With each story - some that will make you laugh, some that deal with loss, many that are filled with love and revelation - we, the listeners, get to know the person behind the voice with which we've grown so familiar. </p><p>We had a lot of fun putting this together, and we wholeheartedly thank our narrators for so generously sharing their voices and helping to brighten our holiday season. </p><p>From all of us here at Audible - happy holidays and happy listening! </p><p>CHAPTER GUIDE </p><p></p><ul><li>Chapter 1: Introduction </li><li>Chapter 2: Jonathan Davis </li><li>Chapter 3: Kate Reading </li><li>Chapter 4: Michael Kramer </li><li>Chapter 5: Scott Brick </li><li>Chapter 6: Katherine Kellgren </li><li>Chapter 7: Ray Porter </li><li>Chapter 8: Piper Goodeve </li><li>Chapter 9: Ari Fliakos </li><li>Chapter 10: Andi Arndt </li><li>Chapter 11: Edoardo Ballerini </li><li>Chapter 12: Gabra Zackman </li><li>Chapter 13: Gabriel Vaughn </li><li>Chapter 14: Khristine Hvam </li><li>Chapter 15: Allyson Johnson </li><li>Chapter 16: Kirby Heyborne </li><li>Chapter 17: Cassandra Campbell </li><li>Chapter 18: Holter Graham </li><li>Chapter 19: Therese Plummer </li><li>Chapter 20: Kevin R.
