The Coalition, which has brought peace through uniting the world under a single banner, wants her dead. But none of their case against her adds up. </p> <p>Stasik can’t help but need to know why. </p> <p>Hours after taking her under his department's protection, a cybernetically enhanced hitman nips at Stasik's heels.
