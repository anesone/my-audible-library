window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Emmy winner Emma Thompson lends her immense talent and experienced voice to Henry James' Gothic ghost tale, <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>. </p> <p>When a governess is hired to care for two children at a British country estate, she begins to sense an otherworldly presence around the grounds. Are they really ghosts she's seeing? Or is something far more sinister at work? </p> <p>Having performed in films based on some of the greatest works in literature - including <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, <i>Howards End</i>, <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, and <i>Henry V</i> - Thompson is no stranger to the classics, and she lends a graceful eloquence to this moody, macabre story. Joined by listener favorite Richard Armitage, who performs the prologue, Thompson reinvigorates this psychological thriller of life, death, evil, and the unknown. </p>";
