window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bob Odenkirk is a legend in the comedy-writing world, winning Emmys and acclaim for his work on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, <i>Mr. Show with Bob and David</i>, and many other seminal television shows. This book, his first, is a spleen-bruisingly funny omnibus that ranges from absurdist monologues (\"Martin Luther King Jr.'s Worst Speech Ever\") to intentionally bad theater (\"Hitler Dinner Party: A Play\"), from avant-garde fiction (\"Obit for the Creator of Mad Libs\") to free-verse poetry that's funnier and more powerful than the work of Calvin Trillin, Jewel, and Robert Louis Stevenson combined. </p> <p>Odenkirk's debut resembles nothing so much as a hilariousnew sketch comedy show that's exclusively available as a streaming video for your mind. As Odenkirk himself writes in \"The Second Meeting of Jesus and Lazarus,\" it is a book \"to be read aloud to yourself in the voice of Bob Newhart\".</p>";
