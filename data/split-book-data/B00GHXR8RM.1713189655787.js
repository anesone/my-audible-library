window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Homicide detective Bryan Clauser is losing his mind. How else to explain the dreams he keeps having - dreams that mirror, with impossible accuracy, the gruesome serial murders taking place all over San Francisco? How else to explain the <i>feelings </i>these dreams provoke in him - not disgust, not horror, but <i>excitement?</i> </p> <p>As Bryan and his longtime partner, Lawrence 'Pookie' Chang, investigate the murders, they learn that things are even stranger than they at first seem. For the victims are all enemies of a seemingly ordinary young boy - a boy who is gripped by the same dreams that haunt Bryan. Meanwhile, a shadowy vigilante, seemingly armed with superhuman powers, is out there killing the killers. And Bryan and Pookie's superiors - from the mayor on down - seem strangely eager to keep the detectives from discovering the truth. </p> <p>Doubting his own sanity and stripped of his badge, Bryan begins to suspect that he's stumbled into the crosshairs of a shadow war that has gripped his city for more than a century - a war waged by a race of killers living in San Francisco's unknown, underground ruins, emerging at night to feed on those who will not be missed. </p> <p>And as Bryan learns the truth about his own intimate connections to the killings, he discovers that those who matter most to him are in mortal dangerâ€¦and that he may be the only man gifted - or cursed - with the power to do battle with the <i>nocturnals</i>. </p> <p> Featuring a dazzlingly plotted mystery and a terrifying descent into a nightmarish underworld - long with some of the most incredible action scenes ever put to paper, and an explosive, gut-wrenching conclusion you won't soon forget, <i>Nocturnal</i> is the most spectacular outing to date from one of the genre's brightest stars. </p>";
