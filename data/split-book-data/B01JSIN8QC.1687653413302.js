They hope this sacrifice will keep her from terrorizing their town. But the witch in the forest, Xan, is kind and gentle. She shares her home with a wise Swamp Monster named Glerk and a Perfectly Tiny Dragon, Fyrian. Xan rescues the abandoned children and delivers them to welcoming families on the other side of the forest, nourishing the babies with starlight on the journey. </p> <p>One year Xan accidentally feeds a baby moonlight instead of starlight, filling the ordinary child with extraordinary magic.

Meanwhile, a young man from the Protectorate is determined to free his people by killing the witch.
