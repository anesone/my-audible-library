window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tony Award-winning actor Billy Crudup shines as Harry Clarke, a shy Midwesterner leading an outrageous double life as a cocky Londoner.</p> <p>Moving to New York City and presenting himself as an Englishman, Harry charms his way into a wealthy family's life, leading an outrageous double life. As the seductive and clever Harry, his increasingly reckless behavior threatens to undo more than his persona. David Cale’s nuanced storytelling and Crudup’s magnetic performance combine, making <i>Harry Clarke</i> a sexually charged and wickedly funny thriller. <i>The New York Times</i> hailed Crudup’s performance in “a sly role terrifically suited to his gifts” while praising Cale’s story as a delicious conceit.</p> <p>This Audible Theater production also features a special performance of Cale’s Obie Award-winning, one-man show Lillian, starring the playwright himself in a typical tale of romance told through the eyes of a proper, middle-aged Englishwoman.&nbsp;</p>";
