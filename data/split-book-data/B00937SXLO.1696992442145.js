window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Nominee, Solo Narration - Female, 2013</b></p> <p></p> <p>At the age of 22, Jennifer Worth left her comfortable home to move into a convent and become a midwife in postwar London’s East End slums. The colorful characters she met while delivering babies all over London - from the plucky, warm-hearted nuns with whom she lived to the woman with 24 children who couldn't speak English to the prostitutes and dockers of the city’s seedier side - illuminate a fascinating time in history. Beautifully written and utterly moving, <i>Call the Midwife</i> will touch the hearts of anyone who is, and everyone who has, a mother.</p>";
