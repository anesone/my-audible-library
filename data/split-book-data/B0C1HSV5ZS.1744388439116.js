window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two years before the events of </b><b><i>Stranger Things: </i></b><b>Season 4, Eddie Munson—Hellfire Club leader, metalhead, and Hawkins outcast—has one shot to make it big.</b> </p> <p>Hawkins, Indiana: For most, it’s simply another idyllic, manicured all-American town. But for Eddie Munson, it’s like living in a perpetual Tomb of Horrors. Luckily, he has only a few more months to survive at Hawkins High. And what is senior year, really, but killing time between Dungeons &amp; Dragons sessions with the Hellfire Club and gigs with his band, Corroded Coffin?</p> <p>At the worst dive bar in town, Eddie meets Paige, someone who has pulled off a <i>freaking miracle</i>. She escaped Hawkins and built a wickedly cool life for herself working for a record producer in Los Angeles<i>.</i> Not only is she the definition of a badass—with killer taste in music—but she might also be the only person who actually appreciates Eddie as the bard he is instead of as the devil incarnate. But the best thing? She’s offering him a chance to make something of himself, and all he needs to do is get her a demo tape of Corroded Coffin’s best songs.</p> <p>Just one problem: Recording costs money. Money Eddie doesn’t have. But he’s willing to do whatever it takes, even if that means relying on his dad. Al Munson has just stumbled back into Eddie’s life with another dubious scheme up his sleeve, and yet Eddie knows this is his only option to make enough dough in enough time. It’s a risk, but if it pays off he will finally have a one-way ticket out of Hawkins. </p> <p>Eddie can feel it: 1984 is going to be his year.</p>";
