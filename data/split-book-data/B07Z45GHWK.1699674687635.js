window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Humanity's last hope...</b></p> <p>With Earth rapidly becoming inhospitable to human life, GS <i>Archean</i> carries a one-way crew of courageous passengers to Uelara, an Earth-like planet in the Cieri star system. Uelara is ideal, except for one minor detail - its distance from Earth. Traveling at sub-light speed, the generation ship won’t reach Uelara within the original crew’s lifetime.</p> <p>Thirty years into the journey, a new generation born on the <i>Archean</i> trains to fulfill the first generation’s mission. Eager to reach Uelara, the second-gen crew prepares, as planned, to assume their parents’ responsibilities - that is, until...someone goes missing and a devastating secret is discovered, putting the future of the human race in jeopardy. Will the crew rally and carry out the mission - or is humanity doomed?</p> <p>It’s all up to the <i>2nd Gen</i>.</p> <p><i>\"The ultimate test of man’s conscience may be his willingness to sacrifice something today for future generations whose words of thanks will not be heard.\" (Gaylord Nelson)</i></p>";
