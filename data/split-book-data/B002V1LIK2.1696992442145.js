window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Narnia...where anything can happen (and most often does), and where the adventure begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The <i>Dawn Treader</i> is the first ship Narnia has seen in centuries. King Caspian has built it for his first voyage to find the seven lords, good men whom his evil uncle Miraz banished when he usurped the throne. The journey takes Edmund, Lucy, their cousin Eustace, and Caspian to the Eastern Islands, beyond the Silver Sea, toward Aslan's country at the End of the World.</p> <p><i>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</i>&nbsp;is the fifth book in C. S. Lewis' classic fantasy series, a series that has been drawing readers of all ages into a magical land with unforgettable characters for over 60 years. This is a novel that stands on its own, but if you would like to continue to the journey, listen to <i>The Silver Chair</i>, the sixth book in&nbsp;The Chronicles of Narnia.&nbsp;</p>";
