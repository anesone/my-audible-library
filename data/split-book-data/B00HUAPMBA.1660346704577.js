window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Rob Thomas, the creator of the television series and movie phenomenon <i>Veronica Mars</i>, comes the first audiobook in a thrilling mystery series that picks up where the feature film left off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Ten years after graduating from high school in Neptune, California, Veronica Mars is back in the land of sun, sand, crime, and corruption. She’s traded in her law degree for her old private-investigating license, struggling to keep Mars Investigations afloat on the scant cash earned by catching cheating spouses until she can score her first big case.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, it’s spring break, and college students descend on Neptune, transforming the beaches and boardwalks into a frenzied weeklong rave. When a girl disappears from a party, Veronica is called in to investigate. But this is no simple missing person case; the house the girl vanished from belongs to a man with serious criminal ties, and soon, Veronica is plunged into a dangerous underworld of drugs and organized crime. And when a major break in the investigation has a shocking connection to Veronica’s past, the case hits closer to home than she ever imagined.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Veronica Mars, Rob Thomas has created a groundbreaking female detective who’s part Phillip Marlowe, part Nancy Drew, and all snark. With its sharp plot and clever twists, <i>The Thousand-Dollar Tan Line</i> will keep you guessing until the very last moment.&nbsp;</p>";
