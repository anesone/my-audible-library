window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An unabridged reading of the brand-new novel based on a storyline by Douglas Adams. </p> <p>The Doctor promised Romana the end of the universe, so she's less than impressed when what she gets is a cricket match. But then the award ceremony is interrupted by 11 figures in white uniforms and peaked skull helmets wielding bat-shaped weapons that fire lethal bolts of light into the screaming crowd. The Krikkitmen are back. </p> <p>Millions of years ago, the people of Krikkit learned they were not alone in the universe and promptly launched a xenophobic crusade to wipe out all other lifeforms. After a long and bloody conflict, the Time Lords imprisoned Krikkit within an envelope of Slow Time, a prison that could be opened only with the Wicket Gate key, a device that resembles - to human eyes, at least - an oversized set of cricket stumps.... </p> <p>From Earth to Gallifrey, from Bethselamin to Devalin, from Krikkit to Mareeve II to the far edge of infinity, the Doctor and Romana are tugged into a pan-galactic conga with fate as they rush to stop the Krikkitmen gaining all five pieces of the key. If they fail, the entire cosmos faces a fiery retribution that will leave nothing but ashes.... </p>";
