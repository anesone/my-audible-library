window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The collected BBC radio productions of the major works of Oscar Wilde, plus bonus play by Neil Bartlett.</b></p> <p>Loved for his flamboyant personality, sparkling wit and brilliant epigrams, Oscar Wilde was a comic genius and a literary icon.</p> <p>This collection reflects the many facets of his dazzling talent. Here are dramatisations of his only novel, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, a Gothic tale of a gilded aristocrat who makes a dangerous pact, as well as four scintillating social comedies – <i>Lady Windermere’s Fan, A Woman of No Importance, The Importance of Being Earnest </i>and <i>An Ideal Husband</i>. Among the distinguished casts are Ian MacDiarmid, Joely Richardson, Edward Fox, Diana Rigg, Martin Clunes, Michael Hordern and Judi Dench.</p> <p>Moving examples of his correspondence are revealed in <i>The Letters of Oscar Wilde</i> and <i>De Profundis</i>, read by Simon Callow and Simon Russell Beale respectively, and his most famous poem, <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i>, is performed live by stars including Ian McKellen, Neil Tennant and Stephen Fry.</p> <p>In addition, a bonus drama, <i>In Extremis </i>by Neil Bartlett, starring Corin Redgrave and Sheila Hancock, reimagines Oscar Wilde's hastily arranged sitting with a society palm reader, a week before the trial that would cost him so dearly.</p>";
