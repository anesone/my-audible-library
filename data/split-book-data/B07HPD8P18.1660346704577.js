window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hailed as \"a classic...humorous, full of warmth and real invention\" (<i>The New Yorker</i>), this beloved story - first published more than 50 years ago - introduces readers to Milo and his adventures in the Lands Beyond.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Milo, everything's a bore. When a tollbooth mysteriously appears in his room, he drives through only because he's got nothing better to do. But on the other side, things seem different. Milo visits the Island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping), learns about time from a ticking watchdog named Tock, and even embarks on a quest to rescue Rhyme and Reason!&nbsp;</p> <p>Somewhere along the way, Milo realizes something astonishing. Life is far from dull. In fact, it's exciting beyond his wildest dreams....</p> <p>\"I read [<i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i>] first when I was 10. I still have the book report I wrote, which began 'This is the best book ever.'\" (<i>The New York Times</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"<i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i> is the closest thing we have to a modern <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.\" (<i>The Guardian</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"The book lingers long after turning the final page.... A classic indeed.\" (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)</p>";
