window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A lifesaving handbook for parents of children who are occasionally, or too often, out of control. Most child-behavior books are filled with advice that sounds reasonable, fits with what parents already believe about child-rearing, and is, as Dr. Kazdin proves, guaranteed to fail.</p> <p><i>The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child</i> makes available to parents for the first time Dr. Kazdins proven programone backed up by some of the most long-term and respected research devoted to any therapy for children. Kazdin shatters decades worth of accumulated myths about tantrums, time-outs, punishments fitting the crime, and much more.</p> <p>With the practicality of Ferber and the warmth of Brazelton, Kazdin leads parents through every step of the Kazdin Method in action - how to use tone of voice, when and how to touch, how to lead your child in a practice session, how to adjust your approach for different-age children, how to involve siblings, and more.The program is temporary, but the results are permanent - for very young children, adolescents, and even beyond.</p>";
