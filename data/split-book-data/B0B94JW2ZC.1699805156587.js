window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Discover the thrilling origin stories of the bard Edgin, the barbarian Holga, and their whole adventuring party in this official prequel to </b><b><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.</i></b></p> <p>Edgin Darvis’s life is a mess. All that he has left are his lute, his dashing good looks, and his daughter, Kira. After a chance encounter with badass bruiser Holga, Edgin is forced to take a hard look at his bad choices. But the road to redemption is long and paved with unforeseen expenses. Fortunately, the world is full of rich fools begging to be parted from their money.</p> <p>And so Edgin and Holga do what any sensible entrepreneurs would do—they form a crew.</p> <p>Joined by the charming rogue Forge Fitzwilliam and Simon, a sorcerer with an intense inferiority complex, the team sets out to line their pockets with both well-earned and ill-gotten gold. Together, Edgin’s crew battles monsters across the realms: gnoll raiders, fey witches, and more fall beneath their sharp weapons and sharper wit. But when they encounter a new, more sophisticated villain, keen blades and piercing blue eyes may not be enough.</p> <p>Their target? Torlinn Shrake, a wealthy eccentric known for abusing his servants and hosting lavish parties.</p> <p>The plan? Play dress-up, sneak into the Shrake estate, and fill their pockets with as much loot as they can carry.</p> <p>The catch? Shrake is hiding a terrible secret: one that could endanger the lives of everyone Edgin has come to care for—even if the loot is too good to pass up.</p>";
