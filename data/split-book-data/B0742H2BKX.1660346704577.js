window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A hilarious fantasy book bundle! </p> <p>Book one: <i>A Quest of Undoing</i> </p> <p>Follow Master Wizard Xebdigon Whizzfiddle as he struggles to complete a nearly impossible quest in only 30 days. He must help an enormous dwarf, an unattractive elf, a knight who is afraid of his own shadow, a lizard who is launching a nudie magazine, and a squashed-down giant who believes he's a wizard. Failure will cost Whizzfiddle his guild membership, but success may land him in the Afterlife! Fortunately booze is his magical power source, so at least he'll be mentally befuddled during the entire ordeal. </p> <p>Book two: <i>The Full Moon Event</i> </p> <p>Paulie Vergen is a vampire living the daily grind of life until a fateful day when a newly infected Werewolf landed on his doorstep. All Paulie wanted was peace and quiet, but life didn't often seem to care about his plans. He's now faced with helping the poor werewolf navigate through the Underworld in order to find the help that he needs. </p> <p>Book three: <i>Bob the Zombie</i> </p> <p>Bob is a zombie who was just going about his business when a band of thieves stole his hand so that they could make a batch of Elfagra in the Upperworld. While it's bad enough that they've stolen Bob's hand for such a purpose, it comes to the Zombie's attention that if the bad guys use the wrong technique it could cause a cosmic rift that will spell the real death of Bob...not just the long, drawn out one that's part of being a Zombie. </p> <p>Book five: <i>Gappy's Gadgets</i> </p> <p>Gappy Whirligig is an industrious gnome who has yet to reach the Age of Tinkering. In a flash, Gappy's life flips upside down, leaving him to make the decision to either strike out on his own or become a 42-year-old foster child. Gappy demonstrates his industrious spirit as he leaves Hubintegler's rules and regulations behind and instead seeks to make his mark in the seedy town of Planoontik. </p>";
