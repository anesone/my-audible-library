window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An Audible Best of the Year 2023 Celebrity Memoir Selection</b></p> <p><b>This program is read by the author.<br> <br> “...I love him, and I respect him, and I need him. We all do.” —from the foreword, written and read by Jamie Lee Curtis</b><br> <br> If you would have told a young John Stamos flipping burgers at his dad’s fast-food joint that one day he’d be a household name and that, at the height of his success, he’d be living alone, divorced, with no kids, high on a cocktail of forgetting, he might’ve asked, “You want fries with that?” <br> <br> John burst onto the scene in <i>General Hospital</i>, propelling him into the teen idol stratosphere, a place that’s often a point of no return. But Stamos beat the odds and over the past four decades has proved himself to be one of his generation’s most successful and beloved actors. Whether showing off his comedic chops on <i>Full House</i> or his dramatic skills on<i> ER</i>, pushing the boundaries on Broadway or living out his youthful dreams as an honorary Beach Boy, John has surprised everyone, most of all himself.<br> <br> A universal story about friendship, love, loss, and the courage to embrace love once more, John Stamos’s memoir is filled with some of the most memorable names in Hollywood, both old and new. Funny, deeply poignant, and brutally honest, <i>If You Would Have Told Me </i>is a portrait of a boy who went from believing in Disney magic to a man who learns that we have to create our own magical moments in life.<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt &amp; Company.</b></p>";
