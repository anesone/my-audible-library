window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this rich new audio production, acclaimed British American actress Rebecca Hall brings one of E. M. Forster's most admired works to life in this classic tale of human struggle.</p> <p>A charming young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch, is wooed by both free-spirited George Emerson and wealthy Cecil Vyse while vacationing in Italy. Though attracted to George, Lucy becomes engaged to Cecil despite twice turning down his proposals. On hearing of the news, George confesses his love, leaving Lucy torn between marrying the more socially acceptable Cecil or George, the man she knows would bring her true happiness. Should Lucy choose social acceptance or true love?</p> <p>It's both the quintessential Edwardian love story and a classic piece of social comedy, in which Forster is concerned with one of his favorite themes: the \"undeveloped heart\" of the English middle classes, here represented by a group of tourists and expatriates in Florence. Forster's disapproval of the era's restrictive conventions is reflected through his strong observation of character and society.</p> <p><i>A Room with a View</i> was ranked 79th on the Modern Library's list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The 1985 film adaptation by James Ivory won three Oscars.</p> <p><b>Narrator Biography<br> </b>Rebecca Hall is an award-winning British-American actress with extensive credits in stage and screen, including leading roles in <i>Christine</i>, <i>Professor Marston &amp; the Wonder Women</i>, <i>Frost/Nixon</i>, and <i>Vicky Christina Barcelona</i>. As the daughter of two theater veterans - the stage director and Royal Shakespeare Company founder Peter Hall and the opera singer Maria Ewing - Rebecca began acting from an early age, and her mastery of the craft is on full display in her nuanced performance of <i>A Room With a View</i>, her debut audiobook narration.&nbsp;</p>";
