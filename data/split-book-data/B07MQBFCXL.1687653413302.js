window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>About the audiobook: </b></p> <p><i>The Worldship Humility</i> is the start of The Code trilogy, written exclusively for audio by sci-fi author R. R. Haywood. Narrator Colin Morgan brings the colourful characters and treacherous escapades of <i>The Worldship Humility</i> to life, a gripping space adventure which will appeal to fans of <i>Ready Player One</i>, <i>Bladerunner </i>and Haywood’s previous best-selling works, <i>Extracted</i> and <i>The Undead</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Summary: </b></p> <p>It’s been 120 years since the 50 or so worldships containing the few million survivors set off after planet Earth was destroyed by a meteor.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the Worldship <i>Humility</i>, Sam, an Airlock Operative, is bored. Living in space should be full of adventure, except it isn’t, and he fills his time hacking 3-D movie posters.&nbsp;</p> <p>Petty thief Yasmine Dufont is also from the WS <i>Humility</i>, but she is not bored. Growing up in the Elfors, the lawless lower levels of the ship, has seen her surrounded by violence and squalor since birth, and now she wants out. She wants to escape to the luxury of the Ab-Spa on top of WS <i>Abstinence</i>, where they eat real food instead of rats and synth cubes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, the sleek-hulled, unmanned <i>Gagarin </i>has come back from punching out ahead of the fleet in the ever-continuing search for a new home. Nearly all hope is lost that a new planet will ever be found, until the <i>Gagarin </i>returns with a code of information that suggests a habitable planet has been found. This news should be shared with the whole fleet, but a few rogue captains want to keep the information to themselves and colonise the new planet.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Yasmine inadvertently steals the code, she and Sam become caught up in a dangerous game of murder, corruption, political wrangling and...porridge, with sex-addicted Detective Zhang Woo hot on their heels, his own life at risk if he fails to get the code back.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>About the author: </b></p> <p>R.
