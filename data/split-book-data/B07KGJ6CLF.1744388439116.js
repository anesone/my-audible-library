window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The secret history of David Hasselhoff and the fall of the Berlin Wall - as told by the Hoff himself. </b></p> <p>Autumn, 1989. The waning days of the Cold War. A rogue Stasi colonel has acquired a nuclear bomb and threatens to level Berlin if and when the Wall comes down. CIA Agent Nick Harper is called in to foil the plot. Soon after arriving, however, Harper discovers his identity has been compromised. To stay alive, he must go along with a group of passionate young East Berliners who mistake him for their idol, American superstar David Hasselhoff. </p> <p>Meanwhile, across the Wall, the real David Hasselhoff arrives in West Berlin to play a sold-out show before a hundred thousand adoring German fans, in the name of freedom. But upon crossing into the East as a tourist, Hasselhoff - who bears a striking resemblance to the US operative - unwittingly finds himself caught up in a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse. </p> <p>When the Hoff fails to show up for his concert, Agent Harper is forced to stand in for his famous doppelgänger while the real Hasselhoff must rely on his acting chops and <i>Knight Rider</i> training to save Berlin...and potentially the world.</p>";
