window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If one George Carlin audio is funny, then two are funnier and three must be funniest, right? That's our thinking behind this new collection. It's a HighBridge library of laugh-out-loud, award-winning recordings featuring George himself performing many of his best bits. The set includes: </p> <p><b>Brain Droppings</b><br> Acerbic observations, manic musings, in-your-face questions, witty word play, and more \"droppings\" from Carlin's singular brain. \"I put a dollar in a change machine. Nothing changed.\" \"Why are there no recreational drugs taken in suppository form?\" The first Carlin book on audio and a 2001 Grammy winner. </p> <p><b>Napalm &amp; Silly Putty</b><br> Carlin invents Past-Tense TV (<i>Got Smart, Father Knew Best, It Was Left to Beaver</i>); crusades for the Center for Research into the Heebie Jeebies; founds the George Carlin Book Club (recommended reading: <i>Fill Your Life with Croutons</i>); and suggests that \"If the shoe fits, get another just like it.\" A 2002 Grammy winner. </p> <p><b>More Napalm &amp; Silly Putty</b><br> Everything that wouldn't fit on the first <i>Napalm</i> recording - like \"A Day in the Life of Henry VIII\", \"Sports Should Be Fixed\", compelling confessions (\"I couldn't commit suicide if my life depended on it\"), and candid takes on life's little moments (\"I'm beyond the nice day\"), all delivered with wicked glee.</p>";
