window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Go beyond the film with a novelization featuring new scenes and expanded material. </b></p> <p>As the shadows of the Empire loom ever larger across the galaxy, so do deeply troubling rumors. The Rebellion has learned of a sinister Imperial plot to bring entire worlds to their knees. Deep in Empire-dominated space, a machine of unimaginable destructive power is nearing completion. A weapon too terrifying to contemplate...and a threat that may be too great to overcome. </p> <p>If the worlds at the Empire's mercy stand any chance, it lies with an unlikely band of allies: Jyn Erso, a resourceful young woman seeking vengeance; Cassian Andor, a war-weary rebel commander; Bodhi Rook, a defector from the Empire's military; Chirrut ÃŽmwe, a blind holy man; his crack-shot companion, Baze Malbus; and K-2SO, a deadly Imperial droid turned against its former masters. In their hands rests the new hope that could turn the tide toward a crucial Rebellion victory - if only they can capture the plans to the Empire's new weapon. </p> <p>But even as they race toward their dangerous goal, the specter of their ultimate enemy - a monstrous world unto itself - darkens the skies. Waiting to herald the Empire's brutal reign with a burst of annihilation worthy of its dreaded name: Death Star. </p>";
