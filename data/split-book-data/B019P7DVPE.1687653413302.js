He's disappeared into those murky shadows of menace Epics are infamous for the world over, and everyone knows there's no turning back.... </p> <p>But everyone is wrong. Redemption is possible for Epics - Megan proved it. They're not lost. Not completely. And David is just about crazy enough to face down the most powerful High Epic of all to get his friend back.
