window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Modern parenting is in a complicated place. By some estimates, fathers today spend seven times more time parenting than their dads did. And while there are a ton of parenting books, writer Stephen Marche says that most are aimed at women and are designed to make them feel like they are doing something wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>Enter<i> How Not to F*ck Up Your Kids Too Bad</i>, an Audible Original. Across 10 chapters, Marche talks to real fathers and experts about thorny contemporary questions. He tackles everything from why yelling may be as bad as spanking to how to have tough conversations about racism in literature and how to talk to your kids about marijuana and porn in a way that won’t mess them up as adults…at least not too much.&nbsp;</p>";
