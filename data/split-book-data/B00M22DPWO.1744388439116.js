In a collaboration that’s been years in the making, Martin has teamed with Elio M. García, Jr., and Linda Antonsson, the founders of the renowned fan site Westeros.org - perhaps the only people who know this world almost as well as its visionary creator. </p> <p>Collected here is all the accumulated knowledge, scholarly speculation, and inherited folk tales of maesters and septons, maegi and singers, including:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>full family trees for Houses Stark, Lannister, and Targaryen</li> <li>in-depth explorations of the history and culture of Westeros </li> <li>100% all-new material, more than half of which Martin wrote specifically for this book </li> </ul> <p>The definitive companion piece to George R. R. Martin’s dazzlingly conceived universe, <i>The World of Ice &amp; Fire</i> is indeed proof that the pen is mightier than a storm of swords. </p>";
