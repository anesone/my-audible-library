window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Award-winning actor Nathan Fillion (</b><b><i>Firefly</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Castle</i></b><b>,</b><b><i> The Rookie</i></b><b>) brings to life a snarky artificial intelligence you won't soon forget.

They thought wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>An AI overseer and a human crew arrive on a distant planet to salvage an ancient UN starship. The overseer is unhappy. The crew, well, they're certainly no A-team. Not even a C-team on the best of days. And worse? Urmahon Beta, the planet, is at the ass-end of nowhere. Everybody expects this to be a long, ugly, and thankless job.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then it all goes disastrously wrong. What they thought was an uninhabited backwater turns out to be anything but empty. Megafauna roam the land, a rival crew with some terrifyingly high-powered gear haunts the dig site, and a secret that will change humanity forever is waiting in the darkness.</p> <p>Stuck on this unmapped, hostile planet, lacking resources, and with tech built by the cheapest bidder, the salvage crew must engineer their way to payday...and beat Urmahon Beta before it kills them all.</p>";
