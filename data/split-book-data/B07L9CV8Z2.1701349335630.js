window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>My Man Jeeves</i>, first published in 1919, introduced the world to affable, indolent Bertie Wooster and his precise, capable valet, Jeeves. Some of the finest examples of humorous writing found in English literature are woven around the relationship between these two men of very different classes and temperaments. Where Bertie is impetuous and feeble, Jeeves is coolheaded and poised.&nbsp;</p> <p>This audiobook, the first collection of Jeeves and Wooster stories, includes \"Absent Treatment\", \"Helping Freddie\", \"Rallying Round Old George\", \"Doing Clarence a Bit of Good\", \"Fixing It for Freddie\", and \"Bertie Changes His Mind\".</p>";
