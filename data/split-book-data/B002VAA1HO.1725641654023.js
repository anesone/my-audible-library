window.bookSummaryJSON = "When diplomacy has failed and military intervention is deemed inappropriate, our leaders often turn to a silent and dark community for results. This is a course of action not always taken by wise and honorable men. In certain circles it is known as \"the third option.\" <p> Fresh from retaking a battle-scarred White House after a vicious terrorist attack, Mitch Rapp, the C.I.A.'s top counter-terrorism operative, is sent on his final mission. His target: a well-known German industrialist who has been selling highly sensitive equipment to one of the world's most notorious sponsors of terrorism. As Rapp meticulously prepares to take the man out, he has no idea that there are forces within his own government who are plotting to use him.</p> <p>The conspirators have devised a bold plan that will damage the president and ruin the career of the incoming director of the C.I.A.'s Counter-terrorism Center. Unfortunately, they have made one horrible miscalculation: they have chosen Mitch Rapp as their pawn. Their worst nightmare is about to be realized. They have enraged one of the most lethal and efficient killers the C.I.A. has ever produced - and he will stop at nothing to find out who set him up.</p>";
