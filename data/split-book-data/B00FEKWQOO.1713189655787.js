Combining his trademark comic voice and very real expertise in woodworking - he runs his own woodshop - <i>Paddle Your Own Canoe</i> features tales from Offerman's childhood in small-town Minooka, Illinois - \"I grew up literally in the middle of a cornfield\" - to his theater days in Chicago, beginnings as a carpenter/actor and the hilarious and magnificent seduction of his now-wife Megan Mullally. It also offers hard-bitten battle strategies in the arenas of manliness, love, style, religion, woodworking, and outdoor recreation, among many other savory entrees.</p> <p>A mix of amusing anecdotes, opinionated lessons and rants, sprinkled with offbeat gaiety, <i>Paddle Your Own Canoe</i> will not only tickle readers pink but may also rouse them to put down their smart phones, study a few sycamore leaves, and maybe even handcraft (and paddle) their own canoes. </p>";
