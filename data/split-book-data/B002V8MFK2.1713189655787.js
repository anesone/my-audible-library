window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The passionate and tragic story of Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff is one of the high points of 19th-century Romantic literature. In the relationship of Cathy and Heathcliff, and in the wild, bleak Yorkshire Moors of its setting, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> creates a world of its own, conceived with a disregard for convention and an instinct for poetry and the darkest depths of the human soul in torment.</p>";
