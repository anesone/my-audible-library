window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A pathbreaking history of the United States' overseas possessions and the true meaning of its empire </b></p> <p>We are familiar with maps that outline all 50 states. And we are also familiar with the idea that the United States is an \"empire\", exercising power around the world. But what about the actual territories - the islands, atolls, and archipelagos - this country has governed and inhabited? In <i>How to Hide an Empire</i>, Daniel Immerwahr tells the fascinating story of the United States outside the United States. In crackling, fast-paced prose, he reveals forgotten episodes that cast American history in a new light.&nbsp;</p> <p>We travel to the Guano Islands, where prospectors collected one of the 19th century's most valuable commodities, and the Philippines, site of the most destructive event on US soil. In Puerto Rico, Immerwahr reveals how US doctors conducted grisly experiments they would never have conducted on the mainland and charts the emergence of independence fighters who would shoot up the US Congress. In the years after World War II, Immerwahr notes, the United States moved away from colonialism. Instead, it put innovations in electronics, transportation, and culture to use, devising a new sort of influence that did not require the control of colonies. Rich with absorbing vignettes, full of surprises, and driven by an original conception of what empire and globalization mean today, <i>How to Hide an Empire</i> is a major and fully enjoyable work of history.</p>";
