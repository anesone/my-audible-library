window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Dad is Fat,</i> stand-up comedian Jim Gaffigan, who’s best known for his legendary riffs on Hot Pockets, bacon, manatees, and McDonald's, expresses all the joys and horrors of life with five young children - everything from cousins (\"celebrities for little kids\") to toddlers’ communication skills (\"they always sound like they have traveled by horseback for hours to deliver important news\"), to the eating habits of four-year-olds (\"there is no difference between a four-year-old eating a taco and throwing a taco on the floor\"). <i>Dad is Fat</i> is sharply observed, explosively funny, and a cry for help from a man who has realized he and his wife are outnumbered in their own home.</p>";
