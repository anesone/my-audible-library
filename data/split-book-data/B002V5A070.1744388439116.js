Now it's up to Rapp to pull out all the stops.</p> <p> Rapp immediately leaves for Afghanistan, where he leads a special forces unit on a daring commando raid across the border into a remote Pakistani village. Their target: an al-Qaeda stronghold. Within a subterranean room, Rapp and his team discover plans for a catastrophic nuclear attack on Washington, DC.</p> <p> Information is quickly relayed back to CIA headquarters, and a nuclear emergency support team scrambles to the scene.
