window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The 13th Sign</i> is a chilling journey down a cosmic path, as ancient as creation itself. And in the final confrontation with the past, present, and future,<i> The 13th Sign </i>will ultimately determine if life on Earth will go on, or perish...the future is now in the hands of those who believe.&nbsp;</p> <p>In reference to the author, “My lifelong struggle with dyslexia was always a struggle. In school, it was always terribly difficult for me to read what was right in front of me. And reading, writing, and spelling still to this day remain difficult for me. One thing I’ve learned despite having this learning disability, I can accomplish my goals, if I don’t, get overwhelmed by the big picture...I just take one step at a time.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Ted Lazaris, who created DragonMan and wrote eight novels in the series, which are being developed and produced by ThunderBall Films, has accomplished the amazing feat of debuting at number one on Amazon Kindle, ahead of David Baldacci and James Patterson novels. Lazaris received the attention and a letter of commendation from former First Lady Laura Bush, who commented, “I admire your efforts, through writing adventure stories, to encourage people of all ages to enjoy reading.”&nbsp;</p> <p>The amazing story of DragonMan was born at the dawn of the 21st century, when the world, about to change forever, watched in disbelief as four passenger airliners crashed, not only into buildings and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, but into the American certainty that the horrors of the outside world could not touch them at home. It was into this world that a new kind of superhero emerged, one for whom the lines between good and evil are blurred. Is he friend? Or is he foe? No one knows for sure. What they do know, however, is that as a friend there is no one better.</p>";
