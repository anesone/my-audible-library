Whether analyzing a classic Gene Kelly routine, relishing a Nelson-Jeanette operetta, or touting a dynamic hip hop number (in the underrated <i>Idlewild</i>), she is a canny and charismatic guide to the many ways that song and dance have been seen - and heard - on film.</p> <p>With extensive portraits of everyone from Al Jolson, the Jazz Singer; to Doris Day, whose iconic sunniness has overshadowed her dramatic talents; from Deanna Durbin, that lovable teen-star of the '30s and '40s; to Shirley T. and Judy G.; from Bing to Frank to Elvis; from Ann Miller to Ann-Margret; from Disney to <i>Chicago</i>...focusing on many beloved, iconic films (<i>Top Hat</i>, <i>Singin' in the Rain</i>,<i> Meet Me in St. Louis</i>,<i> The Sound of Music</i>) as well as unduly obscure gems (Eddie Cantor's <i>Whoopee!</i>,<i> Murder at the Vanities</i>, <i>Sun Valley Serenade</i>,<i> One from the Heart</i>), this audiobook is astute, informative, and a pure pleasure to hear.</p>";
