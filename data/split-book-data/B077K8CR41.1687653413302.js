window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From \"America's nerviest journalist\" (<i>Newsweek</i>) - a breathtaking epic, a magnificent adventure story, and an investigation into the true heroism and courage of the first Americans to conquer space. \"Tom Wolfe at his very best\" (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) </p> <p>Millions of words have poured forth about man's trip to the moon, but until now few people have had a sense of the most engrossing side of the adventure: namely, what went on in the minds of the astronauts themselves - in space, on the moon, and even during certain odysseys on earth. It is this, the inner life of the astronauts, that Tom Wolfe describes with his almost uncanny empathetic powers that made <i>The Right Stuff</i> a classic. </p> <p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: </p> <p>Tom Wolfe is the author of more than a dozen books, among them such contemporary classics as <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i>, <i>The Right Stuff</i>, <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i> and <i>A Man in Full</i>. A native of Richmond, Virginia, he earned his B.A. at Washington and Lee University and a PhD. in American studies at Yale. He lives in New York City. </p> <p>ABOUT THE NARRATOR </p> <p>Dennis Quaid is renowned for his distinct portrayals in both comedic and dramatic roles over the past forty years. Quaid can next be seen in Roadside Attraction's faith-based film <i>I Can Only Imagine</i> which will be released on March 16, 2018. </p> <p>Dennis most recently stared in Crackle's auctioneering drama <i>The Art of More</i> on which he also served as an executive producer. On the big screen, he was recently seen starring in Universal's <i>A Dog's Purpose</i> as well as in the fact-based drama <i>Truth</i>. He will next begin filming the third season of the BAFTA award-nominated television series <i>Fortitude</i> and recently completed production on Lionsgate's <i>Kin</i> with James Franco. </p> <p>Quaid began to gain attention in the late 1970s for roles in such films as <i>Breaking Away</i> before gaining public and critical acclaim for his role in the 1983 release <i>The Right Stuff</i>. Other notable credits include <i>The Rookie</i>, <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i>, <i>Traffic</i>, <i>Vantage Point</i>, <i>Frequency</i>, <i>The Parent Trap</i>, and <i>Soul Surfer</i>.
