Now, eleven Emmys and one Peabody Award later, it’s safe to say that the show’s status as a pop culture phenomenon is secure. And, for the first time, <i>New York Times</i> television editor Jeremy Egner explores the creation, production, and potent legacy of <i>Ted Lasso.</i></p> <p>Drawing on dozens of interviews from key cast, creators, and more, <i>Believe </i>takes listeners from the very first, silly NBC Premier League commercial to the pitch to Apple executives, then into the show’s writer’s room, through the brilliant international casting, and on to the unforgettable set and locations of the show itself.</p> <p>Egner approaches his reporting as a journalist and as a cultural critic, but also with an affection and admiration fans will appreciate, carefully and humorously telling <i>Ted Lasso</i>’s story of teamwork, of hidden talent, of a group of friends looking around at the world’s increasingly nasty discourse and deciding that maybe simple decency still had the power to bring us together—a story about what happens when you dare to believe.</p> <p><b>* This audiobook edition includes a downloadable PDF with the Source Notes from the printed book.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
