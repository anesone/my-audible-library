[His] stories work better in audio than in print.” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>\"The Trunchbull\" is no match for Matilda!&nbsp;</p> <p>Matilda is a sweet, exceptional young girl, but her parents think she's just a nuisance. She expects school to be different, but there she has to face Miss Trunchbull, a kid-hating terror of a headmistress. When Matilda is attacked by the Trunchbull she suddenly discovers she has a remarkable power with which to fight back. It'll take a superhuman genius to give Miss Trunchbull what she deserves, and Matilda may be just the one to do it!&nbsp;</p>";
