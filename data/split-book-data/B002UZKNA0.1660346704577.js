window.bookSummaryJSON = "Getting a new job or a big promotion is like building a house: You need to get the foundation right for both. With a job, the quick-drying cement is how well you do in your first hundred days, since they establish the foundation for long-term momentum and great performance. <p> Tom Neff and Jim Citrin are two of the world's leading experts on leadership and career success. As key figures at Spencer Stuart (hailed by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> as the number one brand name in executive search), they must understand the criteria for success when they recruit top executives for new leadership positions.</p> <p> Tom Neff and Jim Citrin's actionable eight-point plan will be the foundation for your success, whether you are moving to a new organization or being promoted, showing how to:<br> </p> <li> Prepare yourself mentally, physically, and emotionally from the time you accept until the time you begin </li> <li> Manage others' expectations of you, bosses, colleagues, and subordinates </li> <li> Shape and build the team that will work with you </li> <li> Learn the lay of the land and find out how things \"really work around here\" </li> <li> Communicate your story effectively to people inside and outside the organization </li> <li> Avoid the top 10 traps that confront every new leader, such as disrespecting your predecessor, misreading the true sources of power in the organization, or succumbing to the \"savior syndrome\"<p> When you start a new job you are in what AOL's Jon Miller calls a \"temporary state of incompetence\", faced with having to do the most when you know the least. But with the eight-point plan of <i>You're in Charge, Now What?</i> you'll understand and be able to take action on the patterns that will build your success.</p></li>";
