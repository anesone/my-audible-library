window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Snuggle up with three delightful tales of dogs and drinks from the minds of </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling authors Delilah S. Dawson, Kevin Hearne, and Chuck Wendig.</b></p> <p>Oberon the Irish wolfhound and his Boston terrier buddy, Starbuck, not only witness humans waste perfectly good sausage, but also a sneaky murder committed right before their eyes in <b>THE CHARTREUSE CHANTEUSE </b>by Kevin Hearne. Justice demands that someone pay for both crimes, and together with their Druid, Atticus O'Sullivan, and D.I. Rose Badgely of the Launceston police, they'll show the dastardly villain they messed with the wrong good dogs.</p> <p><b>THE BARTENDER AND THE BEAST</b> introduces the enchanting world of Arcadia Falls, the setting for Delilah S. Dawson's return to Paranormal Romance. When no-nonsense bartender Cassia King returns to her sleepy hometown in the Georgia mountains to help her sister, she can’t help falling for well-dressed wildlife rehabilitator Riley. But as Cash learns, Arcadia Falls has a secret, and so does the bar's rescue pit bull, Peach Pit...</p> <p>In <b>WHISKEY SOUR</b> by Chuck Wendig, <i>It was the end of the world and Harry Campbell wanted a drink</i>. He's one of the few who remained in Ouray, Colorado, after everything went to hell—and has decided to willfully fall off the wagon and find a way to make a cocktail he once loved, the whiskey sour. His quest to make a drink will take him beyond the borders of Ouray and into the world fallen under the shadow of the now-gone White Mask disease. But, he won't do it alone—Shepherd Marcy Reyes lends him the courage and pluck of the golden retriever known as Gumball to help him stay alive and stay sane in the process. But Harry's journey holds a greater, more secret purpose—he has questions that remain unanswered about what the rogue AI called Black Swan did to them all, and he intends to have those answers, even if they change him, and perhaps the world, forever.</p>";
