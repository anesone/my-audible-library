window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of the 2024 Audie Award for Autobiography/Memoir</b><br> <br> <b>THE </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> AND </b><b><i>USA TODAY </i></b><b>BESTSELLER</b><br> <br> <b>The renowned and bestselling memoir—written with “insight, truth, and passion” (Sir Ian McKellen)—from iconic, beloved actor and living legend Sir Patrick Stewart.</b><br> <br> From his acclaimed stage triumphs to his legendary onscreen work, Sir Patrick Stewart has captivated audiences around the world and across multiple generations in a career spanning six decades with his indelible command of stage and screen. No other British working actor enjoys such career variety, universal respect, and unending popularity, as witnessed through his seminal roles—whether as Captain Jean-Luc Picard of <i>Star Trek</i> fame, Professor Charles Xavier of Marvel's <i>X-Men</i> hit movie franchise, his more than forty years as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company, his unforgettable one-man show adapted from Charles Dickens’s <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, or his comedic work in <i>American Dad!</i>, <i>Ted</i>, <i>Extras</i>, and <i>Blunt Talk</i>, among many others. Now, he presents his stunning memoir, a revealing portrait of a driven artist whose astonishing life—from his humble beginnings in Yorkshire, England, to the heights of Hollywood and worldwide acclaim—proves a story as exuberant, definitive, and enduring as the author himself.</p>";
