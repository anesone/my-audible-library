window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Audiobook read by Zachary Levi</p> <p><b><i>I'm not an expert, therapist, pastor, teacher, or monk. I am merely a person going through my own mental and emotional health journey, hoping that I can pass on some of the wisdom and tools that I'd been blessed enough to learn along the way. And I truly believe that if we can help heal the hearts and minds of everyone on earth, we will solve every other problem known to man in the process. -- Zachary Levi</i></b></p> <p><i>Radical Love</i> is the debut memoir from Zachary Levi (<i>Shazam!</i>,<i> American Underdog</i>,<i> The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i>,<i> Chuck</i>), which shares his emotional journey through a lifetime of crippling anxiety and depression to find joy, gratitude, and ultimate purpose. Facing the scars of childhood trauma and the voices in his head that told him he would never be enough, Zac recounts the raw yet honest behind-the-scenes story of his family life, career successes, and the personal disappointments that led him to rock bottom and landed him in a therapy center, where he learned to address the underlying issues that preceded his downward spiral.</p> <p><i>Radical Love</i> combines witty, touching, and powerful commentary with relatable illustrations to help you on your own path toward mental wellness. With vulnerability and humor, Zac relates the valuable lessons and insights heâ€™s learned so that you can rise from the ashes of trauma and pursue a meaningful life of gratitude.</p>";
