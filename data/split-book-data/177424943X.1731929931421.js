They’ll do anything to bury it.</b> </p> <p>Henry Stasik, an Internal Affairs agent for the globe-spanning Coalition, is no stranger to crooked agents or scandals. He's a truth-junkie. An addict. But when international celebrity Anastasia Danicheva specifically demands his presence at a police station, everything changes. The Coalition, which has brought peace through uniting the world under a single banner, wants her dead. But none of their case against her adds up. </p> <p>Stasik can’t help but need to know why. </p> <p>Hours after taking her under his department's protection, a cybernetically enhanced hitman nips at Stasik's heels. Witnesses disappear or turn up in pools of blood. And lurking above it all, guarded by a genocidal AI construct, is a secret that threatens to dismantle a perfect world and–Stasik himself. </p> <p><b><i>Man in the High Castle</i></b><b> meets </b><b><i>Blade Runner</i></b><b> with a dash of </b><b><i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. </i></b><b>in this breakneck sci-fi spy thriller set in a drug-fueled alternate history from the number one Audible best-selling author of </b><b><i>Titanborn</i></b><b>, Rhett C.
