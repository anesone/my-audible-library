window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tehran, Iran 1979: Simmering religious tensions explode and the Shah is forced to flee Iran. A British helicopter company—secretly owned by the Noble House of Hong Kong—with a fleet of helicopters registered in Iran faces bankruptcy if their copters are claimed or destroyed by the uprising. The pilots need to escape, but they’ve built lives in Iran, some even have families. Finnish pilot Erikki Yokkonen has married Azadeh, an Iranian woman of noble birth, whose family is caught up in the political situation exploding around them. Tasked with saving as many of the helicopters as he can and desperate to save his love, Erikki and Azadeh become caught up in the events around them.</p> <p>Threaded throughout master storyteller James Clavell’s novel <i>Whirlwind</i> much like a shimmering strand of silk woven through an elaborate Persian carpet, is the love story of two people from different backgrounds. They have been brought together by a love stronger than either one, a love stronger than the revolutionary fires that burn all around them. A moving story, expertly told, unthreaded from the original masterwork, and allowed to stand on its own, brilliantly.</p>";
