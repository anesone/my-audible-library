On a planet without hard metals, or the means of escape, iron offers the promise of freedom through the chance to build a spacecraft. <p>But it is a promise which may never be fulfilled, as Lanik uncovers a treacherous conspiracy beyond his imagination. Now charged with a mission of conquest - and exile - Lanik devises a bold and dangerous plan to finally break the vicious chain of rivalry and bloodshed that enslaves the people of the planet Treason.</p>";
