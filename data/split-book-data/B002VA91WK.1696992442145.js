window.bookSummaryJSON = "The radio dramatisation of <i>The Hobbit</i> became a classic when it was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1968 and it continues to delight today. <p>Tolkien's famous saga, the prelude to the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, has all the ingredients of fantasy and adventure: dwarves, elves, goblins and trolls, a fearsome dragon, a great wizard, a perilous quest, and a dramatic climax. At the centre is the unsuspecting hero Bilbo Baggins, a home-loving unambitious Hobbit who is suddenly thrust into the biggest, indeed the only adventure of his life.</p>";
