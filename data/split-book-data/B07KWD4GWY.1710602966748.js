window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Luke Starr: Milwaukee boy. Crown prince of Spellville, aka DragonMan.</p> <p>Ten years ago, Luke discovered he was the chosen one of Spellville, a magical alternate dimension. He used his abilities as DragonMan to fight against the ruthless Unter. With the help of his great-grandfather Alaba and the other wizards of Spellville, Luke banished Unter into the inescapable Eon Vault. All was well. Until a supernova lends Unter the power to break free.... Now, the evil one is back and stronger than ever.</p> <p>Outraged by his previous defeat, Unter will hit Luke where it hurts most. Followers. Friends. Family. Kidnapping one of Lukeâ€™s sisters and his girlfriend, Jenny Anderson, Unter will take one hostage on Earth, the other on Spellville. While the dragon is distracted by his loved ones in peril, the evil one will begin to terraform both worlds for his dying race.</p> <p>Luke must make a choice: the Earth or Spellville, his sister or the woman he loves....</p> <p>A cat-and-mouse game with no rewards, only consequences. Our young hero must quickly adapt to this experiment in terror or watch his world be destroyed by a godlike being bent on revenge.</p> <p>Time is running out, chosen one. Tick tock.... Tick tock....</p> <p>The amazing story of DragonMan was born at the dawn of the 21st century, when the world, about to change forever, watched in disbelief as four passenger airliners crashed, not only into buildings and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, but into the American certainty that the horrors of the outside world could not touch them at home.</p> <p>It was into this world that a new kind of superhero emerged, one for whom the lines between good and evil are blurred. Is he friend? Or is he foe? No one knows for sure. What they do know, however, is that as a friend there is no one better. </p> <p>Ted Lazaris is an American best-selling author with seven best-sellers to his name, so far; the titles are as follows: <i>DragonMan - The Adventures of Luke Starr</i>, <i>DragonMan - The Poseidon Encounter</i>, <i>DragonMan - Face of the Unknown</i>, <i>DragonMan - Descendants of Man</i>, <i>DragonMan: Unfathomable</i>, <i>DragonMan: Experiment in Terror</i>, and <i>DragonMan - The Awakening</i>.</p>";
