(<i>Sunday Telegraph</i>).</p> <p>Before Liz Lemon, before <i>Weekend Update</i>, before Sarah Palin, Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: A recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV. She has seen both these dreams come true.</p> <p>At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon - from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.</p> <p>Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've always suspected: You're no one until someone calls you bossy.</p> <p>Includes special, never-before-solicited opinions on breastfeeding, princesses, Photoshop, the electoral process, and Italian rum cake!</p>";
