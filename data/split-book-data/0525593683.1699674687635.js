window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Go big or go gnome. The&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;best-selling authors of </b><b><i>Kill the Farm Boy </i></b><b>welcome you to the world of Pell, the irreverent fantasy universe that recalls Monty Python and Terry Pratchett.</b></p> <p><b>\"A complete delight, as fluffy and fun as The Lego Movie and as heartfelt as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.\" (</b><b><i>Locus</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>War is coming, and it’s gonna be Pell.</p> <p>On one side stand the gnomes: smol, cheerful, possessing tidy cardigans and no taste for cruelty.</p> <p>On the other side sit the halflings, proudly astride their war alpacas, carrying bags of grenades and hungry for a fight. And pretty much anything else.</p> <p>It takes only one halfling bomb, and Offi Numminen’s world is turned upside-down - or downside-up, really, since he lives in a hole in the ground. His goth cardigans and aggressive melancholy set him apart from the other gnomes, as does his decision to fight back against their halfling oppressors. Suddenly Offi is the leader of a band of lovable misfits and outcasts - from a gryphon who would literally kill for omelets to a young dwarf herbalist who is better with bees than with his cudgel to an assertive and cheerful teen witch with a beard as long as her book of curses - all on a journey to the Toot Towers to confront the dastardly villain intent on tearing Pell asunder. These adventurers never fit in anywhere else, but as they become friends, fight mermaids, and get really angry at this one raccoon, they learn that there’s nothing more heroic than being yourself.</p> <p>In <i>No Country for Old Gnomes</i>, Delilah S. Dawson and Kevin Hearne lovingly tweak the tropes of fantasy and fairy tales. Here you’ll find goofy jokes and whimsical puns, but you’ll also find a diverse, feminist, and lighthearted approach to fantasy that will bring a smile to your face and many fine cheeses to your plate.</p>";
