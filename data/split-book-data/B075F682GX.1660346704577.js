window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Notable Book</b></p> <p><b>National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist</b></p> <p><b>An NPR Best Book of the Year</b></p> <p><i>God Save Texas</i> is a journey through the most controversial state in America. It is a red state, but the cities are blue and among the most diverse in the nation. Oil is still king, but Texas now leads California in technology exports. Low taxes and minimal regulation have produced extraordinary growth, but also striking income disparities. Texas looks a lot like the America that Donald Trump wants to create.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bringing together the historical and the contemporary, the political and the personal, Texas native Lawrence Wright gives us a colorful, wide-ranging portrait of a state that not only reflects our country as it is, but as it may become - and reveals how the battle for Texasâ€™s soul encompasses us all.</p>";
