window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Wil Wheaton narrates this space opera full of political intrigue and charismatic characters. The young Emperox Grayland II does not have an easy task ahead. The Interdependency is in jeopardy due to the collapse of various planets in the empire. Powerful families are looking out for their own interests, even if that means killing their enemies and threatening the empire. Wheaton delivers an expressive narration using a humorous tone when needed and employing his acting talent to bring the characters to life. This audiobook is a treat not only for Wheaton's fans but also for anyone who is into well-written science fiction.\" (<i>AudioFile</i> magazine) </p> <p><i>The Consuming Fire</i> - the sequel to the 2018 Hugo Award Best Novel finalist and 2018 Locus Award-winning <i>The Collapsing Empire</i> - an epic space-opera novel in the best-selling Interdependency series, from the Hugo Award-winning and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author John Scalzi.</p> <p>The Interdependency, humanityâ€™s interstellar empire, is on the verge of collapse. The Flow, the extra-dimensional conduit that makes travel between the stars possible, is disappearing, leaving entire star systems stranded. When it goes, human civilization may go with it - unless desperate measures can be taken. </p> <p>Emperox Grayland II, the leader of the Interdependency, is ready to take those measures to help ensure the survival of billions. But nothing is ever that easy. Arrayed before her are those who believe the collapse of the Flow is a myth - or at the very least, an opportunity that can allow them to ascend to power. </p> <p>While Grayland prepares for disaster, others are preparing for a civil war, a war that will take place in the halls of power, the markets of business and the altars of worship as much as it will take place between spaceships and battlefields. The Emperox and her allies are smart and resourceful, but then so are her enemies. Nothing about this power struggle will be simple or easy...and all of humanity will be caught in its widening gyre. </p> <p>The Interdependency series: </p> <p></p> <ol> <li><i>The Collapsing Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Consuming Fire</i></li> </ol>";
