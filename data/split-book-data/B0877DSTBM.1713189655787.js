When he found meditation, it inspired him to switch gears in a big way. He founded The Big Quiet, a mass meditation movement that gathers thousands of people for large-scale moments of quiet around the world (including for Oprahâ€™s 2020 Vision Tour with WW).</p> <p>In this meditation designed to help you sleep, Jesse guides you to synchronize your inhalations and exhalations to the deeply relaxing sounds of vibrating crystal bowls played by Jackie Cantwell to quiet your mind and body before bed.</p> <p>This title is part of a collection of audio experiences created to deliver your best sleep during this difficult time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jackie Cantwell: Crystal bowls</p>";
