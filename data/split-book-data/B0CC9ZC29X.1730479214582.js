Yet where does he get the resources needed to advance his work. With whom do his new allegiances lie?</p> <p>Bishop is pursued by Colonial Marines Captain Marcel Apone, commander of the <i>Il Conde </i>and younger brother of Master Sergeant Alexander Apone, one of the casualties of the doomed mission to LV-426. Also on his trail are the “Dog Catchers,” commandos employed by Weyland-Yutani.</p> <p>Who else might benefit from Bishop’s intimate knowledge of the deadliest creatures in the galaxy?</p>";
