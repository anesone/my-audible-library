window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this sound bath experience, renowned sound therapist, meditation teacher, and author Sara Auster harnesses the power of peaceful sounds and quiet guidance to help calm your mind and relax your body before bed. Linger softly in the pre-slumber state as Sara helps you access a gentle transition into restful sleep. She will guide your breathing while playing a variety of soothing, overtone-emitting instruments, including tuning forks, crystal singing bowls, and more. Sara has specially designed these recordings with the intention for rest and, ultimately, sleep.</p> <p>In order to get the most out of your listening experience, she recommends you dim the lights and lie down or sit in a comfortable position with an eye mask and a blanket, silence any alerts or notifications, and use earphones. These things allow you to completely unplug and connect with the present moment to intentionally prepare for sleep. Your body has permission to slow down and rest, to receive without the need to respond or react.</p> <p>Begin your experience by focusing on your breath, then allow yourself to drift into a spacious and dreamlike state. All you have to do is arrive with an open mind, and listen.</p> <p>Sara Auster is the leading voice in sound bath experiences, and considered a pioneer and master of the form. Sara has been featured in The New York Times, Vogue, TIME, and O, The Oprah Magazine, and she has facilitated large-scale, site-specific sound bath experiences at iconic venues around the world including the Museum of Modern Art, Madison Square Garden, Palais de Tokyo, and SummerStage in Central Park. Her live sound bath events are celebrated as transformative, therapeutic experiences for balance, relaxation, and well-being. We’re thrilled to be able to bring this unique sound experience to the comfort of your own bedroom for the first time.</p> <p>This title is part of a collection of audio experiences created to deliver your best sleep during this difficult time</p>";
