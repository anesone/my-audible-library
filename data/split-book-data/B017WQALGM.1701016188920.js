window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER •&nbsp;In the eighth book in The Iron Druid Chronicles, two-thousand-year-old Druid Atticus O’Sullivan faces the clan of vampires who have been bent on</b> <b>destroying him—including Leif, his former best friend turned enemy.</b><br> <br> When a Druid lives as long as Atticus does, he’s bound to run afoul of a few vampires—make that legions of them. Even his former friend and legal counsel turned out to be a bloodsucking backstabber. Now the toothy troublemakers—led by power-mad pain-in-the-neck Theophilus—are no longer content to live undead and let live. Atticus needs to make a point—and drive it into a vampire’s heart.<br> <br> As always, Atticus wouldn’t mind a little backup. But his allies have problems of their own. Ornery archdruid Owen Kennedy is having a wee bit of troll trouble: Turns out when you stiff a troll, it’s not water under the bridge. Meanwhile, Granuaile is desperate to free herself of the Norse god Loki’s mark and elude his powers of divination—a quest that will bring her face-to-face with several Slavic nightmares.<br> <br> As Atticus globe-trots to stop his vampire nemesis, the journey leads to Rome. What better place to end an immortal than the Eternal City? But poetic justice won’t come without a price: In order to defeat Theophilus, Atticus may have to lose an old friend.<br> <br> <b>Don’t miss any of&nbsp;The Iron Druid Chronicles:</b><br> <b><i>HOUNDED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>HEXED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>HAMMERED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>TRICKED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>TRAPPED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>HUNTED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>SHATTERED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>STAKED</i></b><b>&nbsp;| </b><b><i>SCOURGED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>BESIEGED</i></b></p>";
