window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives?</p> <p>The primary obstacle is a conflict that's built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed best seller<i> Made to Stick</i>.</p> <p>Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems - the rational mind and the emotional mind - that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort - but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.</p> <p>In <i>Switch</i>, the Heaths show how everyday people - employees and managers, parents and nurses - have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results:</p> <ul> <li>The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients</li> <li>The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping</li> <li>The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer service</li> </ul> <p>In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change</p> <p><i>Switch</i> shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.</p>";
