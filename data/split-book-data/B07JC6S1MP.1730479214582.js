window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When H. G. Wells first published <i>The War of The Worlds</i> in 1898, the novel quickly became a sci-fi classic. The story of extraterrestrials from Mars invading Earth captured the public’s imagination, inspiring a famed 1938 radio broadcast with Orson Welles, several feature films, countless video games, and a best-selling musical concept album by Jeff Wayne in 1978, among others.</p> <p>Immersing listeners in a world that is as thrilling as it is desolate, Jeff Wayne’s eerie and pulsating score brings the suspense, drama, and urgency of Wells’s original novel to a fever pitch in this Audible Original Drama. Michael Sheen headlines an ensemble cast of talented performers that also includes Taron Egerton, Adrian Edmondson, Theo James, and Anna-Marie Wayne.</p> <p>©2018 Music Masters: Sony Music Entertainment</p> <p>©2018 Existing compositions: Universal Music Publishing Group, Jeff Wayne Music (Publishing) Ltd</p> <p>©2018 Newly composed music: Jeff Wayne Music (P)2018 Audible, Ltd</p>";
