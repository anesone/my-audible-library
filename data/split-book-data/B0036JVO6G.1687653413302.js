The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. </b><br> <br> <b>“Blockbuster perfection.... A gleefully erudite suspense novel.” —</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b><br> <br> “A pulse-quickening, brain-teasing adventure.” —</b><b><i>People</i></b><br> <br> As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.<br> <br> Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.</p>";
