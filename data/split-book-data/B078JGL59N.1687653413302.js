window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestseller</b></p> <p>One of my dad’s favorite jokes about getting older was: “I went out for coffee when I was twenty-one and when I got back I was fifty-eight!”</p> <p>I get what he meant now. Time flies. My first book, <i>If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a \"B\" Movie Actor</i>, was published back in 2001 and it chronicles the adventures of a “mid-grade, kind of hammy actor\" (my words), cutting his teeth on exploitation movies far removed from mainstream Hollywood.&nbsp;</p> <p>This next book, an “Act II” if you will, could be considered my “maturing years” in show business, when I began to say “no” more often and gravitated toward self-generated material. Taking stock in the overall quality of my life, I fled Los Angeles and moved to a remote part of Oregon to renew, regroup and reload.&nbsp;</p> <p>If that sounds tame, the journey from <i>Evil Dead</i> to <i>Spider-Man</i> to <i>Burn Notice</i> was long, with plenty of adventures/mishaps along the way. I never pictured myself hovering above Baghdad in a Blackhawk helicopter, facing a pack of wild dogs in Bulgaria, or playing an aging Elvis Presley with cancer on his penis - how can you predict this stuff? The sheer lunacy of show business is part of the fun for me and I hope you'll come along for the ride.</p> <p>– Bruce “Don’t Call Me Ash” Campbell</p> <p>An icon of B movies and a champion of independent filmmaking, Bruce Campbell is an actor, director and writer best known for his roles as Ash in the <i>Evil Dead</i> franchise and Sam Axe on the hit TV show <i>Burn Notice</i>.</p> <p>Written and read by Bruce Campbell. Co-written with Craig Sanborn. Recording and sound design by Sean McCoy at Oregon Sound Recording.</p>";
