window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Please note:</b> This content is not for kids. It is for mature audiences only. This audio comedy features adult language and themes, some sexual content, and the kind of talk you leave on the field. Discretion is advised.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>64th Man</i> is an Audible Original starring the world-famous and powerfully funny John Cena, Emmy-nominated actress Anna Chlumsky (<i>Veep</i>), comedy legend Jane Curtin, and an all-star cast of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> performers and alums. Produced by Broadway Video, this sports comedy is not an audiobook - it’s a 10-episode scripted audio series that’s like TV for your ears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In sports, everybody loves redemption stories, the underdog who no one believes in but through sheer hard work wins it all. But no one tells the stories of the players who work hard and don’t make it. In pro football, 53 guys get on the roster. Ten make it to the practice squad. And then there’s the 64th Man - that’s Billy Logan (Cena), who seems to always be one spot from glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>After a promising college career capped by a headline-making, game-winning play, Billy seems destined to be drafted to the NFL. But he isn’t, and after a year of tryouts and near misses, he still hasn’t made it pro. So, he returns home to Columbus, Ohio, to figure out how to make his great gridiron dream come true. With a new job at a grocery store, Billy reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Ellen (Chlumsky), but generally it’s embarrassing to be back in town, seeing as he was the “star who was going places”, and now he’s seen as the “star who never went anywhere”. Looking for an opening to the end zone, Billy will tackle anything to make his dream come true. It’s a path that leads him to a billionaire tech bro starting a new professional football league that has more in common with professional wrestling, a health guru selling a cult-like fitness craze, and a hard-partying NFL quarterback who needs a real-life tackle dummy for his football video game. Will these lateral runs lead Billy to NFL stardom? A life of love with his ex? Or something totally unexpected from an elderly mentor named Mildred (Curtin) who he trains at the gym?&nbsp;</p> <p>Written by Bryan Tucker, senior writer at <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, and Zack Phillips, former head writer at <i>Above Average</i> and its sports site The Kicker, this hard-hitting underdog story with a touch of romance also features Leslie Jones, Adam Pally, Chris Redd, Alex Moffat, Jay Pharaoh, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Will Forte, Heidi Gardner, and more. Listen to Billy’s journey as he learns what happens when you're fourth and inches from your dream, but the game clock is running out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
