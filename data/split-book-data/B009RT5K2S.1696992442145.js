window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Orson Scott Card’s <i>Ender’s Game</i> is a classic of science fiction. Though it began its life as a short story, it was later expanded into a Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novel, served as a springboard for a much larger universe of stories, and finally has been made into a feature film.</p> <p>In <i>Ender’s World</i> over a dozen writers of science fiction, fantasy, and young adult books offer new perspectives on the 1985 novel, along with insights gleaned from other Ender stories that fit within the Ender’s Game chronology, including <i>Ender in Exile</i> and <i>Ender’s Shadow.</i> In addition, military strategists Colonel Tom Ruby and Captain John Schmitt offer insight into the human-Formic war. Also included is a contribution from Aaron Johnston, the coauthor of the Formic Wars prequel novels.</p> <p>The collection's insightful analyses and moving personal essays are rounded out with short pieces answering more technically oriented questions about the Ender universe, including why the Battle Room is a cube and why the military recruited their soldiers as children.</p> <p>Edited by Orson Scott Card himself, who also provides an introduction to the anthology as well as to the individual essays, <i>Ender's World</i> is aimed both at listeners who have kept up with the many books that came after and at those who simply want to revisit the original novel.</p>";
