window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audible Originals and the team from RiffTrax present an intergalactic tale of intrigue and Olympic heroism in this multicast, sci-fi comedy adventure! </b></p> <p>Kara Everglades has just finished her first year of high school and is longing for an adventure. So far, her only option is an invitation from some upperclassmen to watch them race a bunch of bullfrogs in a ditch. To be honest, she was hoping for something a bit more exciting.</p> <p>Her grandfather, Cornelius Everglades, is a family legend (and a loose cannon), who founded his own island micronation. Unfortunately, the rest of the world refuses to acknowledge it (possibly because he’s gone about the nation-building process using wildly illegal and unethical means).</p> <p>When Cornelius shows up at Kara’s door needing her help and promising an adventure, Kara agrees to go along with his far-fetched plan, even though a) she thought Cornelius was dead, and b) his scheme depends heavily on Kara wearing a mascot costume.</p> <p>If Kara had only known about the giant alien spaceship currently speeding toward her grandfather’s country with the intent to subjugate and humiliate mankind, she might have reconsidered.</p> <p>Full cast of voice actors and performers: Bill Corbett, John DiMaggio, Jackie Kashian, Colin Mahan, Kevin Murphy, Mike Nelson, Eliza Skinner, Dulce Sloan, Reggie Steele, Paul F. Tompkins, Janet Varney, Scott Vermeire, “Weird Al” Yankovic, and Sasheer Zamata.</p>";
