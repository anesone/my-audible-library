window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Exclusively written for Audible, only available in audio</b> </p> <p><i>\"I think </i>Romeo and Juliet<i> is the greatest, most tragic love story ever told. What David Hewson did with this script is so exciting to me. I really love the fact that he followed avenues that Shakespeare suggested but didn't necessarily detail in depth. If you want to immerse yourself in a warm bath of Garganega and the heat of Verona and hear a brilliant story about a young woman who is challenging the restraints of her time, listen to this audiobook, which has romance, poetry, politics, and humor to spare.\"</i> (Narrator Richard Armitage) </p> <p>It's a story you think you know: the age-old tale of \"star-cross'd lovers\"; two families at war; a romance, so pure and absolute, fated for a tragic end. It's a story so thoroughly embedded in our culture, and so frequently retold. Yet, nothing captures the spark, the possibility, and the surprise of Shakespeare's work quite like this.... </p> <p>In <i>Romeo and Juliet: A Novel</i>, author David Hewson reworks and expands on the classic story so that it becomes something richer, something new and entirely its own. Much more than a simple love story, it is a brilliant examination of young versus old, hope against despair, and, for Juliet, the search for individual identity at a time when women were regarded as little more than chattel. </p> <p>An original production commissioned by Audible, <i>Romeo and Juliet: A Novel</i> marks the second pairing of David Hewson and actor Richard Armitage, whose previous partnership resulted in Audible's 2014 Audiobook of the Year, <i>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark: A Novel</i>. Hewson's talent for writing for audio is undeniable, and he finds his perfect vocal foil in Armitage, an actor of immense range and absorbing intensity. Together, they bring you a familiar story told in a surprising way - with an ending you might not expect. </p> <p><b>Bonus</b>: Audiobook includes an afterword written and narrated by David Hewson. </p>";
