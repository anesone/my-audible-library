window.bookSummaryJSON = "Fearless counterterrorism operative Mitch Rapp finds himself directly in the line of fire in the latest riveting political thriller from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Vince Flynn. <p>For years, Mitch Rapp's bold actions have saved the lives of countless Americans. His battles for peace and freedom have made him a hero to many, and an enemy to countless more. In the tangled, duplicitous world of espionage, there are those, even among America's allies, who want to see Mitch Rapp eliminated. They have decided the time has come.</p> <p>Now, the powerful father of a dead terrorist demands vengeance in its simplest form, an eye for an eye, and Rapp instantly becomes the target of an international conspiracy. This time, he must use all of his vigilance and determination to save himself before he can turn his fury on those who have dared to betray him.</p> <p><i>Consent to Kill</i> takes listeners behind the headlines and catapults them to the front lines of the global war on terror. It sizzles \"with inside information, military muscle, and CIA secrets\" (Dan Brown). Vince Flynn mixes military technology with his exclusive knowledge of Washington politics to create a hero that Americans will wish existed outside the realm of fiction.</p>";
