At this crucial moment, the lives of three radically different women converge, with potentially explosive results.</p> <p>Two have grown up as part of the first generation to come of age in the new order. The testimonies of these two young women are joined by a third: Aunt Lydia. Her complex past and uncertain future unfold in surprising and pivotal ways.</p> <p>With <i>The Testaments</i>, Margaret Atwood opens up the innermost workings of Gilead, as each woman is forced to come to terms with who she is, and how far she will go for what she believes.</p>";
