window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The outrageous and often hilarious autobiography of legendary session musician and lead guitarist and singer of Toto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>No one explodes one of the longest held misconceptions of music history better than Steve Lukather and his band Toto. The dominant sound of the late ‘70s and ‘80s was not punk, but a slick, polished amalgam of rock and R&amp;B first staked out on Boz Scaggs’ <i>Silk Degrees</i>. That album was shaped in large part by the founding members of Toto, who were emerging as the most in-demand elite session crew in LA, and further developed on the band’s self-titled multiplatinum debut. A string of massive hits followed for Toto while Lukather and bandmates David Paich, Jeff Porcaro, and Steve Porcaro also served as creative linchpins on some of the most successful and influential records of the era, including Michael Jackson’s <i>Thriller</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In this incisive memoir, Lukather tells the complete Toto story. He also lifts the lid on what went on behind the closed studio doors, shedding light on the unique creative processes of some of the most legendary names in music: from Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney, Stevie Nicks, and Elton John to Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell, Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Roger Waters, and Aretha Franklin. Lukather’s extraordinary tale also encompasses the dark side of stardom and the American dream. Frank, engaging, and often hilarious, <i>The Gospel According to Luke</i> is no ordinary rock memoir. It is the real thing.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
