window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Solo Narration - Male, 2013</b></p> <p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Classic, 2013</b></p> <p>Narrator Dan Stevens (<i>Downton Abbey</i>) presents an uncanny performance of Mary Shelley's timeless gothic novel, an epic battle between man and monster at its greatest literary pitch. In trying to create life, the young student Victor Frankenstein unleashes forces beyond his control, setting into motion a long and tragic chain of events that brings Victor to the very brink of madness. How he tries to destroy his creation, as it destroys everything Victor loves, is a powerful story of love, friendship, scientific hubris, and horror.</p>";
