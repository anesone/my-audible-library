window.bookSummaryJSON = "This brilliant new treatment of the world's oldest epic is a literary event on par with Seamus Heaney's wildly popular <i>Beowulf</i> translation. Esteemed translator and best-selling author Stephen Mitchell energizes a heroic tale so old it predates Homer's <i>Iliad</i> by more than a millennium. <p>In the ancient city of Uruk, the tyrannical King Gilgamesh tramples citizens \"like a wild bull\". The gods send an untamed man named Enkidu to control the ruthless king, but after fighting, Enkidu and Gilgamesh become great friends and embark on a series of adventures. They kill fearsome creatures before Enkidu succumbs to disease, leaving Gilgamesh despondent and alone. Eventually, Gilgamesh moves forward, and his quest becomes a soul-searching journey of self-discovery.</p> <p>Mitchell's treatment of this extraordinary work is the finest yet, surpassing previous versions in its preservation of the wisdom and beauty of the original.</p>";
