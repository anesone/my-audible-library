window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Betrayed by Earth's heroes and exiled into outer space, the man-monster known as the Incredible Hulk has landed on the distant planet Sakaar, ruled by the tyrannical Red King. Sold into slavery, the Hulk becomes the Green Scar, the planet's mightiest gladiator! But his new masters get more than they bargained for when he forges a bond of brotherhood with his fellow fighters: crafty insectoid Miek, the horrific Brood, wise rock-man Korg, Shadow Warrior Hiroim, noble-born rebel Elloe, and her loyal guardsman Skee. Together, these gladiators start a revolution that could change their entire world - or destroy it.</p>";
