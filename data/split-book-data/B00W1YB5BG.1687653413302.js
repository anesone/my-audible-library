window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"A surprise from the author of <i>Chocolat</i>,\" <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Joanne M. Harris, \"this pacy adult fantasy is narrated by Loki, the Norse god of fire and mischief\" (<i>Vogue</i>). </p> <p>This novel is a brilliant first-person narrative of the rise and fall of the Norse gods - retold from the point of view of the world's ultimate trickster, Loki. A number-one best seller in the UK, <i>The Gospel of Loki</i> tells the story of Loki's recruitment from the underworld of Chaos; his many exploits on behalf of his one-eyed master, Odin; through to his eventual betrayal of the gods and the fall of Asgard. </p> <p>Using her lifelong passion for the Norse myths, <i>New York Times</i> best seller Joanne M. Harris has created a vibrant and powerful fantasy novel that the <i>Sunday Sun</i> recommends \"to her long-standing audience with wit, style and obvious enjoyment\"; <i>The Sunday Times</i> claims it \"lively and fun\"; and <i>The Metro</i> adds that \"Harris has enormous fun with her antihero...this mythical bad boy should beguile fans of Neil Gaiman\". </p>";
