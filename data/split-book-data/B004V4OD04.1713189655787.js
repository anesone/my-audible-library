window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The first novel in the Iron Druid Chronicles - introducing a cool, new, funny urban fantasy hero </b></p> <p>Atticus O’Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound. His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old - when in actuality, he’s twenty-one <i>centuries</i> old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer. </p> <p>Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he’s hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power - plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish - to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil. </p> <p>Don’t miss any of Kevin Hearne’s phenomenal Iron Druid Chronicles novels: <br> <i>Hounded</i> | <i>Hexed</i> | <i>Hammered</i> | <i>Tricked </i>| <i>Trapped</i> | <i>Hunted </i>| <i>Shattered </i>| <i>Staked</i></p>";
