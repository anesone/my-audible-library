window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>All children misbehave for a variety of reasons, sometimes simply to test how far they can go or to get the attention they crave. Other children are more difficult to parent than others because they are impulsive, hyperactive, inattentive, or delayed in some aspect of their development. This invaluable handbook provides parents with guidelines to help prevent behavior problems from occurring; and also with strategies to promote children's social, emotional, and academic competence. </p> <p>This is a parenting guide for parents of children ages two- to eight years old, written by the Incredible Years series developer Dr. Carolyn Webster-Stratton. </p>";
