Fairytale rats thought long extinct with the rest of the fey rescue Eli from murderous vigilantes, but at a cost. They force him to save fairy matrons stolen away by Thoth's monsters, thrusting Eli between his old company and a shadow war waged against humanity. </p> <p>To stop the war, cure Thoth's victims, and rescue the city, Eli need only find some way to make magic out of trash.</p>";
