window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the second, action comic-like installment, DragonMan - <i>The&nbsp;Poseidon Encounter</i>, Luke seems to have come to terms with his legacy&nbsp;and appears well in control of his superpowers - which he will be&nbsp;called upon to use this time around to save the world from an evil demon&nbsp;who seeks to claim the souls of every human being on earth. The mood of impending danger is set from the very beginning when author Ted Lazaris takes off his gloves to delivering a knock-out of an opening scene: Five-year-old Bobby Blakely, running downstairs on the morning of his birthday finds not the hoped-for brand new bicycle as a gift, but rather an enormous blue whale that has somehow washed up in the small lake on his parent’s isolated farm.</p> <p>While many consider the whale’s appearance a hoax, others believe it to be a sign of impending biblical doom. And it is enough to rouse Luke’s suspicions that worse is about to happen - which it does. In a pace that never flags, <i>The Poseidon Encounter </i>unfolds in a complex thread of differing tales, from an old-fashioned detective murder mystery to a science fiction fantasy, all neatly stitched together by an intriguing cast of characters, both good and evil and not-exactly-as-they-seem.</p> <p>DragonMan is not your typical Superman/Batman adventure. It is about the adventures of Luke Starr, a superhero, yes, but he is so much more than that. Recommend for (pre-teen all the up to an adult). Age Level: seven - 12.</p> <p><b>It's A Magical Adventure For All Ages</b></p>";
