window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Like many others on the autism spectrum, 20-something stand-up comic Michael McCreary has been told by more than a few well-meaning folks that he doesn’t “look” autistic. But, as he’s quick to point out in this memoir, autism “looks” different for just about everyone with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). </p> <p>Diagnosed with ASD at age five, McCreary got hit with the performance bug not much later. During a difficult time in junior high, he started journaling, eventually turning his pain into something empowering - and funny. He scored his first stand-up gig at age 14 and hasn't looked back. </p> <p>This unique and hilarious #OwnVoices memoir breaks down what it’s like to live with autism for readers on and off the spectrum. <i>Funny, You Don’t Look Autistic</i> is an invaluable and compelling listen for young readers with ASD looking for voices to relate to as well as for listeners hoping to broaden their understanding of ASD.</p>";
