window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><strong>Originally published in 1932, this outstanding work of literature is more crucial and relevant today than ever before.</strong></p> <p><strong>“One of the most prophetic dystopian works of the 20th century” —</strong><em><strong>Wall Street Journal</strong></em></p> <p>Cloning, feel-good drugs, antiaging programs, and total social control through politics, programming, and media—has Aldous Huxley accurately predicted our future? With a storyteller’s genius, he weaves these ethical controversies in a compelling narrative that dawns in the year 632 AF (After Ford, the deity). When Lenina and Bernard visit a savage reservation, we experience how Utopia can destroy humanity.</p> <p>A powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations, <em>Brave New World</em> is both a warning to be heeded and thought-provoking yet satisfying entertainment.</p>";
