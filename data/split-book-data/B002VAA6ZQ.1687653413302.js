window.bookSummaryJSON = "About three things I was certain. <p>First, Edward was a vampire.</p> <p>Second, there was a part of him, and I didn't know how dominant that part might be, that thirsted for my blood.</p> <p>And Third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.</p> <p>Isabella Swan's move to Forks, a small, perpetually rainy town in Washington, could have been the most boring move she ever made. But once she meets the mysterious and alluring Edward Cullen, Isabella's life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn. Up until now, Edward has managed to keep his vampire identity a secret in the small community he lives in, but now nobody is safe, especially Isabella, the person Edward holds most dear. The lovers find themselves balanced precariously on the point of a knife, between desire and danger.</p> <p>Deeply sensuous and extraordinarily suspenseful, <i>Twilight</i> captures the struggle between defying our instincts and satisfying our desires. This is a love story with bite.</p>";
