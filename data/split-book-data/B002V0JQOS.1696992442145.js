window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>&nbsp;“With <i>American on Purpose</i>, Craig Ferguson somehow manages to avoid the pitfalls of self-indulgence and self-importance that plague most (okay, all) Hollywood autobiographies. He has, instead, written a book that is hilarious and irrepressibly daft, yet also kind, poignant, and undeniably wise. It was a joy to read.” (Dennis Lehane, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Given Day</i>)</p> <p>Ferguson delivers a moving and achingly funny memoir of living the American dream as he journeys from the mean streets of Glasgow, Scotland, to the comedic promised land of Hollywood. Along the way, he stumbles through several attempts to make his mark - as a punk rock musician, a construction worker, a bouncer, and, tragically, a modern dancer. To numb the pain of failure, Ferguson found comfort in drugs and alcohol, addictions that eventually led to an aborted suicide attempt. (He forgot to do it when someone offered him a glass of sherry.) But his story has a happy ending: success on the hit sitcom <i>The Drew Carey Show</i>, and later as the host of CBS's <i>Late Late Show</i>. By far Ferguson's greatest triumph was his decision to become a US citizen, a milestone he achieved in early 2008.</p> <p>In <i>American on Purpose</i>, Craig Ferguson talks a red, white, and blue streak about everything our Founding Fathers feared.&nbsp;</p>";
