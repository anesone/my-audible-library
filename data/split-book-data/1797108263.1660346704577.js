window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>More than two million copies sold</b></p> <p><b>“You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll feel new sympathy for the curmudgeons in your life.” (</b><b><i>People</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Meet Ove. He’s a curmudgeon - the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him “the bitter neighbor from hell”. But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn’t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time?</p> <p>Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove’s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents’ association to their very foundations.</p> <p>Fredrik Backman’s novel about the angry old man next door is a thoughtful exploration of the profound impact one life has on countless others.&nbsp;</p> <p>“If there was an award for ‘Most Charming Book of the Year,’ this first novel by a Swedish blogger-turned-overnight-sensation would win hands down.” (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review)</p>";
