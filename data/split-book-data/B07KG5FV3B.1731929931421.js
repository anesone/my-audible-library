And what of ‘Dodger’, sent to a land halfway around the world, his friend, mentor and master dead because of Oliver? </p> <p><i>Dodge &amp; Twist</i> is that story. The tale of two boys, 12 years later, returning into each other’s lives - for both good and bad.</p> <p>Featuring: Matt Addis, Ben Addis, Tom Michael Blyth, Will Brown, Trevor Cooper, Alexandra Donnachie, Lauren Drummond, Nigel Fairs, David Gooderson, Tom Goodman-Hill, Harry Hepple, Will Howard, James Joyce, Anthony Keetch, Mack Keith-Roach, Matt Lucas, Nick Lucas, Stephen Mangan, William McGeough, David Menkin, Harry Myers,Matty Norgren, Greg Patmore, Miles Richardson, Richard Rycroft, Andy Secombe, Michael Socha, Sheila Steafel, Kara Tointon, Lizzie Waterworth-Santo and Sarah Whitehouse.</p>";
