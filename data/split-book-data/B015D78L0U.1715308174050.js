window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Golden Globe nominee Scarlett Johansson (<i>Lost in Translation</i>, <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>) brings a palpable sense of joy and exuberance to her performance of Lewis Carroll's enduring classic <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>. From the White Rabbit and Mad Hatter to the Cheshire Cat and Queen of Hearts, she imbues each madcap character with a distinct voice and personality that will leave a lasting impression long after the adventure is over. </p> <p>One hundred and fifty years after its original publication, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> remains one of the most widely read, deconstructed, referenced, and reinterpreted works of Western fiction. It tells the story of the young and imaginative Alice, who grows weary of her storybook, one \"without pictures or conversations\", and follows a hasty hare underground - to come face to face with a host of strange and fantastic characters. </p>";
