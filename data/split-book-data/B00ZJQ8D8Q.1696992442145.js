window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Ingenious and beguiling.” - <i>Time</i></p> <p>“Crichton keeps us guessing at every turn in his best work since <i>The Andromeda Strain</i>.” - <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p> <p>“<i>Sphere</i> may be Crichton’s best novel, but even if it ranked only second or third, it would be a must for suspense fans.” - <i>Miami Herald</i></p> <p>A classic thriller from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Michael Crichton, <i>Sphere</i> is a bravura demonstration of what he does better than anyone: riveting storytelling that combines frighteningly plausible, cutting-edge science and technology with pulse-pounding action and serious chills. The gripping story of a group of American scientists sent to the ocean floor to investigate an alien ship, only to confront a terrifying discovery that defies imagination, <i>Sphere</i> is Crichton prime - truly masterful fiction from the ingenious mind that brought us <i>Prey</i>,<i> State of Fear</i>, and <i>Jurassic Park</i>.</p> <p><i>Sphere</i> was made into a film directed by Barry Levinson, which starred Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L. Jackson.</p>";
