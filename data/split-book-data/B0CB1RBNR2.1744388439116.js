window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>A love letter to America from the pen of actor, producer, immigrant, and activist Wilmer Valderrama.</b></p> <p>In this timely memoir, Valderrama looks back on his journey from a tiny pueblo in Venezuela to the big city of Los Angeles—how he discovered his calling as an actor and later as a USO Global Ambassador, found work in Hollywood as an unproven Latino actor, and used his determination and success to build a new life for himself, his family, and many others.</p> <p>Raised by two hard working parents as they navigated their family through a rapidly changing country and the rise of Venezuela's controversial former leader Hugo Chavez, Valderrama delves into his family's flight from their home and the challenges of emigrating to the United States.</p> <p>After being cast in a school theatre production, Valderrama knew he had found his calling and began thinking of ways to help support his struggling family. He would attempt the impossible: find work in Hollywood as an unproven Latino actor. Following countless auditions and frequent criticisms of his accent, he created the personality that would eventually land him the role as Fez on <i>That 70s Show.</i></p> <p>It catapulted him to stardom.</p> <p>Over the coming years, he would create the smash show, <i>Yo Mamma</i>, voice the lead character in Disney's <i>Encanto</i>, and eventually join the cast of <i>NCIS</i>. But it was through service to others and his first USO trip where Valderrama found his further calling—entertaining and encouraging U.S. troops around the world.</p> <p>The saga of a determined soul, <i>An American Story: Everyone's Invited</i> is an exploration of America through the eyes of a young immigrant from Venezuela who had a dream to change the world, a talent for entertaining, and the resolve to build a new life, taking as many as possible with him on the journey.</p> <p>\"<i>This is my way of showing my love, my gratitude to the country that changed my whole life.\"</i></p> <p>The photo insert can be found in the audiobook companion PDF download.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
