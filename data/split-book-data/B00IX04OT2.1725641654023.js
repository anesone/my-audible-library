window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fans of the Divergent series by number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Veronica Roth will be thrilled by <i>Four: A Divergent Collection</i>, a companion volume that includes four pre-Divergent stories told from Tobias' point of view. </p> <p>Listeners first encountered Tobias as \"Four\" in <i>Divergent</i>. His voice is an integral part of <i>Allegiant</i>. Listeners will find more of this charismatic character's backstory told from his own perspective in <i>Four: A Divergent Collection</i>. When taken together, these long narrative pieces illuminate the defining moments in Tobias' life. The first three pieces in this volume - \"The Transfer\", \"The Initiate\", and \"The Son\" - follow Tobias's transfer from Abnegation to Dauntless, his Dauntless initiation, and the first clues that a foul plan is brewing in the leadership of two factions. The fourth story, \"The Traitor\", runs parallel with the events of <i>Divergent</i>, giving listeners a glimpse into the decisions of loyalty - and love - that Tobias makes in the weeks after he meets Tris Prior. </p> <p>Exclusive scenes included!</p>";
