window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Emmy Award-winning actor <b>Bryan Cranston</b> (<i>Breaking Bad, Malcom in the Middle</i>) follows in the exasperated footsteps of Samuel L. Jackson, giving voice to the long-suffering father whose indifferent child will just not eat in this hilarious follow-up to Adam Mansbach's international best seller, <i>Go the F--k to Sleep</i>.</p><p>Mansbach's long-awaited sequel is about that other great parental frustration: getting your little angel to eat something that even vaguely resembles a normal meal. Profane, loving, and deeply cathartic, <i>You Have to F--king Eat</i> breaks the code of child-rearing silence, giving moms and dads (new, old, grand-, and expectant) a much-needed chance to laugh about a universal problem.</p><p>Anchored by a hilarious performance from Cranston, <i>You Have to F--king Eat</i> is the perfect blend of talented voice actor and subversive fun that expertly captures Mansbach’s trademark humor. Due to its explicit language, you probably shouldn't play this one for your kids.</p>";
