window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Mandy Harvey - a young woman who became deaf at age 19 while pursuing a degree in music - reads her inspiring story and how she overcame adversity and found the courage to live out her dreams.</b> </p> <p>When Mandy Harvey began her freshman year at Colorado State University, she could see her future coming together right before her eyes. A gifted musician with perfect pitch, she planned to get a music degree and pursue a career doing what she loved. But less than two months into her first semester, she noticed she was having trouble hearing her professors. In a matter of months, Mandy was profoundly deaf. </p> <p>With her dreams so completely crushed, Mandy dropped out of college and suffered a year of severe depression. But one day things changed. Mandy's father asked her to join him in their once favorite pastime - recording music together - and the result was stunningly beautiful. Mandy soon learned to sense the vibrations of the music through her bare feet on a stage floor and to watch visual cues from her live accompaniment. The result was that she now sings on key, on beat, and in time, performing jazz, ballads, and sultry blues around the country. </p> <p>Full of inspiring wisdom and honest advice, <i>Sensing the Rhythm</i> is a deeply moving story about Mandy's journey through profound loss, how she found hope and meaning in the face of adversity, and how she discovered a new sense of passion and joy. </p>";
