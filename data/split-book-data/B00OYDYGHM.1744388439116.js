window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The macabre, witty <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series (and inspiration for the number one <i>Showtime</i> series, <i>Dexter</i>) continues as our darkly lovable killer matches wits with a sadistic artiste - who is creating bizarre murder tableaux of his own all over Miami. </p> <p>After his surprisingly glorious honeymoon in Paris, life is almost normal for Dexter Morgan. Married life seems to agree with him: he’s devoted to his bride, his stomach is full, and his homicidal hobbies are nicely under control. But old habits die hard - and Dexter’s work as a blood spatter analyst never fails to offer new temptations that appeal to his offbeat sense of justice…and his Dark Passenger still waits to hunt with him in the moonlight. </p> <p>The discovery of a corpse (artfully displayed as a sunbather relaxing on a Miami beach chair) naturally piques Dexter's curiosity and Miami’s finest realize they’ve got a terrifying new serial killer on the loose. And Dexter, of course, is back in business. </p>";
