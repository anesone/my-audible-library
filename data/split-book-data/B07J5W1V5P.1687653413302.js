window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This heartfelt Audible Original, narrated by Emmy and Tony Award-winning actress Mary-Louise Parker, follows three military veterans as they reclaim their most painful memories and turn them into comedy. Michael Garvey, Isaura Ramirez, and Patrick Harth left combat zones to challenge themselves in a stand-up comedy boot camp. As they learn to transform their raw emotions into cathartic experiences, they face the daunting challenge of trying to make an audience laugh with jokes about war, trauma, and mental health. This audio documentary details their move from military service to sharing their searing honesty and gritty strength while performing in front of packed crowds.</p> <p><i>Strong Ending</i> also features insight from professional comedians Rob Riggle (<i>The Daily Show</i>, <i>The Hangover</i>) and Maria Bamford (<i>Lady Dynamite</i>, <i>Arrested Development</i>) as it explores the science behind the healing power of comedy and the role of military comedies in popular culture. A perfect mix of wit and warmth, this is an inspiring and honest listen that unearths the anxieties of readjusting to civilian life and the powerful potential of finding light in the dark.</p> <p><b>About ASAP &amp; Comedy Bootcamp:</b> The Armed Services Arts Partnership (ASAP) is a nonprofit with a mission to cultivate community and growth with veterans, service members, military families, and caregivers through the arts.
