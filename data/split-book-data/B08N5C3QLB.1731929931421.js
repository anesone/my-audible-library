window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Meditation makes you more productive because it lets you earn back time. For each minute you spend meditating, you'll earn around nine minutes back, as Chris Bailey - author of <i>The Productivity Project</i> and <i>Hyperfocus</i> - will show in this candid and counter-intuitive guide to the productivity benefits of meditation. </p> <p><i>How to Train Your Mind</i> digs deep into the practical, tactical benefits of a meditation practice - and how to integrate a meditation ritual into your own life. In addition to calming your mind and allowing you to slow down in an overanxious world, research shows that meditation can de-stimulate your mind so you can think more clearly, procrastinate less, and be more effective at everything you do - at work and at home. </p> <p>Featuring guided meditations designed to fit your busy, unpredictable schedule, <i>How to Train Your Mind</i> is the ideal guide for anyone looking to improve productivity without sacrificing time. While much has been written about the spiritual and intangible benefits of meditation, as far as our productivity is concerned, meditation is in a league all its own.</p>";
