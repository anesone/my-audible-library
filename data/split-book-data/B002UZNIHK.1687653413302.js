window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to a world where big cities are dying, dead - or transformed into technological megastructures. Where once-thriving suburbs are now treacherous Wilds. Where those who live for technology battle those who would die rather than embrace it. It is a world of zero-footprint cities, virtual nations, and armed camps of eco-survivalists.</p> <p>Welcome to the dawn of uncivilization. </p> <p><i>METAtropolis</i> is an intelligent and stunning creation of five of today's cutting-edge science-fiction writers: 2008 Hugo Award winners John Scalzi and Elizabeth Bear; Campbell Award winner Jay Lake; plus fan favorites Tobias Buckell and Karl Schroeder. Together they set the ground rules and developed the parameters of this \"shared universe\", then wrote five original novellas - all linked, but each a separate tale.</p> <p>Bringing this audiobook to life is a dream team of performers: <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>'s Michael Hogan (\"Saul Tigh\"); Alessandro Juliani (\"Felix Gaeta\"); and Kandyse McClure (\"Anastasia 'Dee' Dualla\"); plus legendary audiobook narrators Scott Brick (<i>Dune</i>) and Stefan Rudnicki (<i>Ender's Game</i>).</p> <p>John Scalzi, who served as Project Editor, introduces each story, offering insight into how the <i>METAtropolis</i> team created this unique project exclusively for digital audio.</p>";
