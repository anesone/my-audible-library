window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Once he was a valued key operative in Canada’s special forces.... Now the man known only as Logan has fallen on hard times. Alcoholism, the memory of a disastrous mission in North Korea, and a dark secret known only to himself have all taken their toll on Logan’s tormented soul. Reduced to the level of violent drifter and petty criminal fleeing a murder rap, he is suddenly snatched and spirited to a research complex in the Canadian Rockies...to become a very special guinea pig in a super-secret biotechnology experiment. </p> <p>Under the direction of the brilliant, unscrupulous, and enigmatic Professor, Logan begins an agonizing transformation process to harness his mutant powers and forge him into “Weapon X” - an unstoppable, indestructible killing machine, a bringer of mayhem with retractable harder-than-diamond steel claws and the ability to recover from any wound. But as Logan’s mind and body are invaded and tortured with agonizing procedures in an effort to gain total control over him, the Professor and his gifted team fail to recognize Logan’s unbreakable will, his secret heritage, and his greater destiny - with catastrophic results.</p>";
