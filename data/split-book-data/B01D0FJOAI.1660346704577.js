A policy with Stranger &amp; Stranger can cover all of your interdimensional insurance needs. Rated \"Number One in Customer Satisfaction\" for three years running, no claim is too big or too weird for Tom Stranger to handle. </p> <p>But now Tom faces his greatest challenge yet. Despite being assigned the wrong - and woefully inadequate - intern, Tom must still provide quality customer service to multiple alternate Earths, all while battling tentacle monsters, legions of the damned, an evil call center in Nebraska, and his archnemesis, Jeff Conundrum. Armed with his Combat Wombat and a sense of fair play, can Tom survive? And will Jimmy the Intern ever discover his inner insurance agent? </p> <p>It's time to kick ass and adjust claims. </p> <p>Adam Baldwin (<i>Firefly</i>, <i>Chuck</i>) performs Larry Correia's madcap interdimensional tale of underwriting and space travel, where the only thing scarier than tentacle monsters is a high deductible. </p>";
