window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Celebrated actor, personality, and all-around nerd, Wil Wheaton updates his memoir of collected blog posts with all new material and annotations as he reexamines one of the most interesting lives in Hollywood and fandom--and now for the first time in audio, narrated by Wil himself, with an introduction written and read by Neil Gaiman!</b></p> <p>From starring in <i>Stand by Me </i>to playing Wesley Crusher on <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation </i>to playing himself, in his second (third?) iconic role of Evil Wil Wheaton in <i>The Big Bang Theory, </i>to becoming a social media supernova, Wil Wheaton has charted a career course unlike anyone else, and has emerged as one of the most popular and well respected names in science fiction, fantasy and pop culture.</p> <p>Back in 2001, Wil began blogging on wilwheaton.net. Believing himself to have fallen victim to the curse of the child actor, Wil felt relegated to the convention circuit, and didn’t expect many would want to read about his random experiences and personal philosophies.</p> <p>Yet, much to his surprise, people were reading. He still blogs, and now has an enormous following on social media with well over 3 million followers.</p> <p>In <i>Still Just a Geek, </i>Wil revisits his 2004 collection of blog posts, <i>Just a Geek</i>, filled with insightful and often laugh-out-loud annotated comments, additional later writings, and all new material written for this publication. The result is an incredibly raw and honest memoir, in which Wil opens up about his life, about falling in love, about coming to grips with his past work, choices, and family, and finding fulfillment in the new phases of his career. From his times on the <i>Enterprise </i>to his struggles with depression to his starting a family and finding his passion--writing--Wil Wheaton is someone whose life is both a cautionary tale and a story of finding one’s true purpose that should resonate with fans and aspiring artists alike.</p>";
