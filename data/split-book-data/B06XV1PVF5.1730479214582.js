window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>RETURNING TO TELEVISION AS AN ALL-NEW MINISERIES ON FOX</b></p> <p><i>Cosmos</i> is one of the bestselling science books of all time. In clear-eyed prose, Sagan reveals a jewel-like blue world inhabited by a life form that is just beginning to discover its own identity and to venture into the vast ocean of space. <i>Cosmos</i> retraces the fourteen billion years of cosmic evolution that have transformed matter into consciousness, exploring such topics as the origin of life, the human brain, Egyptian hieroglyphics, spacecraft missions, the death of the Sun, the evolution of galaxies, and the forces and individuals who helped to shape modern science.</p> <p>Includes introductory music: \"Heaven and Hell\" by Vangelis from <i>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</i> used with permission from Druyan-Sagan Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>Cosmos</i></b></p> <p>“Magnificent... With a lyrical literary style, and a range that touches almost all aspects of human knowledge, <i>Cosmos</i> often seems too good to be true.” - <b><i>The Plain Dealer</i></b></p> <p>“Sagan is an astronomer with one eye on the stars, another on history, and a third - his mind’s - on the human condition.” - <b><i>Newsday</i></b></p> <p>“Brilliant in its scope and provocative in its suggestions...shimmers with a sense of wonder.” - <b><i>The Miami Herald</i></b></p> <p>“Sagan dazzles the mind with the miracle of our survival, framed by the stately galaxies of space.” - <b><i>Cosmopolitan</i></b></p> <p>“Enticing...iridescent...imaginatively illustrated.” - <b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p>";
