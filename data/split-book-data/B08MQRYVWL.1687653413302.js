They learn that the \"mother of all motherlodes” discovered there was not unique, that there is another deposit similar to it three miles beneath the towering peak of Cerro Chaltén on the disputed border between Chile and Argentina.</p> <p>O'Doyle, a middle-aged former member of a disgraced black-ops unit, gets his aging team back together to go after this fortune. Funded by the mining company EarthCore, he, Bertha, and his crew of 40-something operators try to turn back the clock long enough to make them all richer than their wildest dreams.</p> <p>But three miles below the surface, where geothermal temperatures will cook you alive, something is waiting. Waiting, and <i>guarding</i>. This time, O’Doyle is well-prepared and well-armed - if he survives, he will be set for life, and he will have his revenge for the Utah massacre.</p>";
