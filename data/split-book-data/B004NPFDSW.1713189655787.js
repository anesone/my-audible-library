window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award, Solo Narration, Male, 2012 </b></p> <p><i>The King's Speech</i> was written by <i>London Sunday Times</i> journalist Peter Conradi and Mark Logue - grandson of Lionel Logue, whose recently discovered diaries and correspondence contain fascinating details about these true events. </p> <p>At the urging of his wife, Elizabeth, the Duke of York (known to the royal family as \"Bertie\") began to see speech therapist Lionel Logue in a desperate bid to cure his lifelong stammer. Little did the two men know that this unlikely friendship - between a future monarch and a commoner born in Australia - would ultimately save the House of Windsor from collapse. </p> <p>Through intense locution and breathing lessons, the amiable Logue gave the shy young Duke the skills and the confidence to stand and deliver before a crowd. And when his elder brother, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne to marry for love, Bertie was able to assume the reins of power as King George VI - just in time to help steer the nation through the dark waters of the Second World War. </p> <p><b>Bonus Audio: This special edition includes a recording of George VI's historic speech announcing to the British people the United Kingdom's 1939 declaration of war with Germany.</b></p>";
