Except for his love life, that is. Feeling distant and lost, Gwen has journeyed to Atlantis, a tolerant and benevolent kingdom governed by the Sorceresses, and a place known to be a safe haven to all female time-travelers. </p><p>Thankfully, Martin and Philip are invited to a summit in Atlantis for all of the leaders of the time-traveler colonies, and now Martin thinks this will be a chance to try again with Gwen. Of course, this is Martin Banks we’re talking about, so murder, mystery, and high intrigue all get in the way of a guy who just wants one more shot to get the girl. </p><p>The follow-up to the hilarious <i>Off to Be the Wizard</i>, Scott Meyer’s <i>Spell or High Water</i> proves that no matter what powers you have over time and space, you can’t control rotten luck. </p><p></p>";
