window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A backstage pass to the groundbreaking hit musical </b><b><i>Hamilton</i></b><b>, winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and 11 Tony Awards, including Best Musical, including the award-winning libretto, behind-the-scenes photos and interviews, and exclusive footnotes from composer-lyricist-star Lin-Manuel Miranda, now streaming on Disney+ with the original cast. </b></p> <p><b>Winner, 2017 APA Audie Awards - Audiobook of the Year</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lin-Manuel Miranda's groundbreaking musical <i>Hamilton</i> is as revolutionary as its subject: the poor kid from the Caribbean who fought the British, defended the Constitution, and helped to found the United States. Fusing hip-hop, pop, R&amp;B, and the best traditions of theater, this once-in-a-generation show broadens the sound of Broadway, reveals the storytelling power of rap, and claims our country's origins for a diverse new generation.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Hamilton: The Revolution</i> gives listeners an unprecedented view into both revolutions, from the only two writers able to provide it. Miranda, along with Jeremy McCarter, a cultural critic and theater artist who was involved in the project from its earliest stages - \"since before this was even a show\", according to Miranda - traces its development from an improbable performance at the White House to its landmark opening night on Broadway six years later.&nbsp;In addition, Miranda has written more than 200 funny, revealing footnotes for his award-winning libretto, the full text of which is published here.&nbsp;</p> <p>Their account features photos by the renowned Frank Ockenfels and veteran Broadway photographer, Joan Marcus; exclusive looks at notebooks and emails; interviews with Questlove, Stephen Sondheim, leading political commentators, and more than 50 people involved with the production; and multiple appearances by President Obama himself. The book does more than tell the surprising story of how a Broadway musical became a national phenomenon: It demonstrates that America has always been renewed by the brash upstarts and brilliant outsiders, the men and women who don't throw away their shot.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
