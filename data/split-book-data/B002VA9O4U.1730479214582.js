window.bookSummaryJSON = "An action-packed and all-too-realistic vision of nations navigating the minefield of international intrigue, <i>Protect and Defend</i> is Vince Flynn's most explosive political thriller yet. The action begins in the heart of Iran, where billions of dollars are being spent on the development of a nuclear program. No longer willing to wait for the international community to stop its neighboring enemy, Israel launches a creative and daring operation that leaves a radioactive tomb in the middle of Iran's second largest city. An outraged Iranian government publicly blames both Israel and the United States and demands retribution. <p> Enter Mitch Rapp, America's top counterterrorism operative. Rapp convinces President Josh Alexander to sign off on a risky operation that will push Iran to the brink of revolution. But when Iran recruits Hezbollah master terrorist Imad Mukhtar, and a CIA effort goes disastrously wrong, Rapp and Mukhtar are set on a collision course that threatens to engulf the entire region in war. With the clock ticking, Rapp is given 24 hours, no questions asked, to do whatever it takes to stop Mukhtar, and avert an unthinkable catastrophe.</p>";
