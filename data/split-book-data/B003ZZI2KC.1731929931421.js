window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The locals in the southern Italian town where he lives call him Signor Farfalla - Mr. Butterfly - for he is a discreet gentleman who paints rare butterflies. His life is inconspicuous: mornings are spent brushing at a canvas, afternoons idling in the cafés, and evenings talking with his friend, the town priest, over a glass of brandy.</p> <p>Yet there are other sides to this gentleman’s life: Clara, the young student who moonlights in the town bordello, and another woman, who arrives with $100, 000 and a commission - but not for a painting of butterflies.</p> <p>With this assignment returns the dark fear that has dogged Signor Farfalla’s mysterious life. Almost instantly, he senses a deadly circle closing in on him, one which he may or may not elude. </p> <p>Part thriller, part character study, part drama of deceit and self-betrayal, <i>The American</i> shows Martin Booth at the very height of his powers. </p> <p>(Previously published as <i>A Very Private Gentleman</i>.)</p>";
