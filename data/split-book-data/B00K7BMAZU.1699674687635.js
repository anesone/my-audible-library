window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Shakespeare's most imaginative and merry play is set in an enchanted wood amidst fairies and sprites.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Oberon, King of the Fairies, uses his magic upon four runaway lovers in a midsummer wood outside Athens, chaos ensues. Who really loves whom? Meanwhile, a band of well-meaning but bungling local actors have their rehearsal sabotaged by the mischievous Puck, who bewitches their leader, Bottom, and Titania, the Fairy Queen. The result is a lively and anarchic comedy that can only be resolved by an elaborate disentangling of spells.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hermia is played by Amanda Root, Oberon by David Harewood, and Bottom by Roy Hudd.&nbsp;</p>";
