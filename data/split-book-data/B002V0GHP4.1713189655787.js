window.bookSummaryJSON = "Harry Enfield stars once again in a brand new full-cast dramatisation of Douglas Adams's second Dirk Gently novel, directed by the award-winning Dirk Maggs <p> Harry Enfield exuberantly returns as Dirk Gently, who, fallen on hard times and dressed as a gypsy woman, is using his irritatingly accurate clairvoyant powers to read palms. He is saved when a frantic client turns up with a ludicrous story about being stalked by a goblin waving a contract accompanied by a hairy, green-eyed, scythe-wielding monster. When Detective Superintendent Gilks decides a headless body found in a sealed room is the result of a particularly irritating suicide, Dirk is plunged into a mystery where the interconnectedness of all things is tested to the limit...</p> <p> This is the second of three series adapted from the Dirk Gently books, directed by Dirk Maggs (chosen by Douglas Adams to conclude the award-winning <i>Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy</i>). Guest stars include Peter Davison (<i>Doctor Who</i>), Jan Ravens (<i>Dead Ringers</i>), Philip Jackson (<i>Poirot</i>), John Fortune (<i>Bremner</i>, <i>Bird &amp; Fortune</i>), Morwenna Banks (<i>Absolutely</i>), Stephen Moore (<i>The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy</i>) and returning cast members Olivia Colman (<i>Peep Show</i>), Jim Carter (<i>The Golden Compass</i>) and Billy Boyd (<i>The Lord Of The Rings</i>). This release contains over 30 minutes of additional unbroadcast material.</p>";
