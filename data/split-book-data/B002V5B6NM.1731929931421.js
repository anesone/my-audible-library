window.bookSummaryJSON = "The choice is yours, and you'll have to live with the consequences for at least the rest of your life. Will you take the blue pill - put this audiobook back and go on thinking of <i>The Matrix</i> as just a movie? Or will you take the red pill - listen to this book, and find out just how far down the rabbit-hole goes? <p>Is the world around us truly as it appears or are we inert bodies in tanks, our brains electronically stimulated to create a make-believe world which is all we know? This old philosophical puzzle has become cutting-edge cool with the appearance of the Keanu Reeves cult sci-fi movie, <i>The Matrix</i>.</p> <p><i>The Matrix</i> is the most philosophical film ever made, every step of its fast-paced plot pivoting on a philosophical conundrum. If the world as we know it is nothing more than our dream, does this make the dream real? If we had the choice to step out of our world into a more real but less pleasant one - to take the red pill - would it be a moral failure not to do so? Why do humans have a value above that of intelligent electronic mechanisms? Can the mind live without the body or the body without the mind?</p> <p>In <i>The Matrix and Philosophy</i>, professional philosophers analyze <i>The Matrix</i> from many angles: metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, and aesthetic. They uncover hidden depths in this intricate work of art, and often reach disturbing conclusions. Those who take the red pill never look at 'the real world' the same way again.</p> <p><i>The Matrix and Philosophy</i> is also available in print from Open Court Books.</p>";
