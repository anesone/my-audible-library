window.bookSummaryJSON = "The story begins with an investigation into some strange reports of an \"opera ghost\", legendary for making the great Paris opera performers ill-at-ease when they sit alone in their dressing rooms. Some allege to have seen the ghost in evening clothes moving about in the shadows. Nothing is done, however, until the disappearance of Christine during her triumphant performance. With an increasing pattern of fear and violence, <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> begins to strike, but always with a beautiful young performer at the center of his deadly desires.";
