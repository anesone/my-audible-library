window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Like a breath of fresh air blowing across all crime-novel conventions, there is Dexter.” </b><b><i>—Time </i></b><br> <br> Dexter Morgan is not your average serial killer. He enjoys his day job as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department . . . but he lives for his nighttime hobby of hunting other killers. Dexter is therefore not pleased to discover that someone is shadowing him, observ­ing him, and copying his methods. Dexter is not one to tol­erate displeasure . . . in fact, he has a knack for extricating himself from trouble in his own pleasurable way. <br> <br> Like the previous five best-selling novels in the Dexter series, <i>Double Dexter</i> showcases the witty, macabre origi­nality that has propelled Jeff Lindsay to international suc­cess. <i>Double Dexter </i>is raucously entertaining . . . full of smart suspense and dark laughs.</p>";
