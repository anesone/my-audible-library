window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The last book written by Ian Fleming, but by no means the least. In <i>Octopussy</i>, a talented but wayward British major pays a high price when his wartime past catches up with him, while in <i>The Property of a Lady</i>, a Fabergé egg leads Bond to a KGB spy. In <i>The Living Daylights</i>, Bond has a perilous rendezvous in sniper's alley between East and West Berlin, and <i>007 in New York</i> (read by Lucy Fleming) sees him sent to America to warn an ex - MI6 operative about a dangerous liaison. All part of the job for 007. </p> <p>This audiobook includes an exclusive bonus interview with Tom Hiddleston. </p> <p>Blackstone Audio, Inc.
