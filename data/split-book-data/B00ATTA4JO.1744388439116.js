window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The final book in the trilogy by <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Beth Revis! </p> <p>Amy and Elder have finally left the oppressive walls of the spaceship <i>Godspeed</i> behind. They're ready to start life afresh - to build a home - on Centauri-Earth, the planet that Amy has traveled 25 trillion miles across the universe to experience. But this new Earth isn't the paradise that Amy had been hoping for. Amy and Elder must race to uncover who - or what - else is out there if they are to have any hope of saving their struggling colony and building a future together. But as each new discovery brings more danger, Amy and Elder will have to look inward to the very fabric of what makes them human on this, their most harrowing journey yet. Because if the colony collapses? Then everything they have sacrificed - friends, family, life on Earth - will have been meaningless.</p>";
