window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The eagerly awaited follow-up to the number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b><b><i>Hamilton: The Revolution,</i></b><b> Lin-Manuel Miranda’s new book gives listeners an extraordinary inside look at </b><b><i>In the Heights,</i></b><b> his breakout Broadway debut, written with Quiara Alegría Hudes, now a Hollywood blockbuster.</b></p> <p><b>“[An] exuberant, unique, and invaluable record of dynamic, brilliant, and soulful creativity.” (</b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><b>, starred review)</b></p> <p>In 2008, <i>In the Heights,</i> a new musical from up-and-coming young artists, electrified Broadway. The show’s vibrant mix of Latin music and hip-hop captured life in Washington Heights, the Latino neighborhood in upper Manhattan. It won four Tony Awards and became an international hit, delighting audiences around the world. For the film version, director Jon M. Chu (<i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>) brought the story home, filming its spectacular dance numbers on location in Washington Heights. That’s where Usnavi, Nina, and their neighbors chase their dreams and ask a universal question: <i>Where do I belong?</i></p> <p><i>In the Heights: Finding Home</i> reunites Miranda with Jeremy McCarter, co-author of <i>Hamilton: The Revolution,</i> and Quiara Alegría Hudes, the Pulitzer Prize-winning librettist of the Broadway musical and screenwriter of the film. They do more than trace the making of an unlikely Broadway smash and a major motion picture: They give listeners an intimate look at the decades-long creative life of <i>In the Heights</i>.</p> <p>Like <i>Hamilton: The Revolution,</i> the audiobook offers untold stories, perceptive essays, and the lyrics to Miranda’s songs - complete with his funny, heartfelt annotations. </p> <p>This is the story of characters who search for a home - and the artists who created one.</p>";
