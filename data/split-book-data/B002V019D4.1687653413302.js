window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> has all the elements of a classic frontier adventure: massacres and raids, innocent settlers, hardened soldiers, renegade Indians, and a doomed love affair. It is a memorable portrait of fierce individualism and moral courage. But what draws readers and listeners again and again to this panoramic novel is its deep insight into the symbols of American consciousness. </p> <p>The French and Indian War adventures of Hawk-eye, a reclusive white woodsman, and his Indian friend Chingachgook have contributed much to the frontier mythos. The story of two men who are at odds with their own people, but reluctantly agree to guide two sisters through hostile Indian country, has found an enduring place in the literary and cultural history of America. </p> <p>James Fenimore Cooper is widely acknowledged as the pre-eminent American writer of his time. <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> is one of his most popular and critically acclaimed works. Larry McKeever's animated and skillful narration intensifies the novel's romance and drama and brings its tragic characters fully to life. </p>";
