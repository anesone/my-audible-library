window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A coming-of-age tale for the young and naïve 17-year-old Catherine Morland, <i>Northanger Abbey</i> takes a decidedly comical look at themes of class, family, love and literature. Revelling in the sensationalist - and extremely popular - Gothic fiction of her day, the story follows Catherine out of Bath to the lofty manor of the Tilneys, where her overactive imagination gets to work constructing an absurd and melodramatic explanation for the death of Mrs Tilney, which threatens to jeopardise her newly forged friendships. </p> <p>This Audible Originals production of <i>Northanger Abbey</i> stars Emma Thompson (Academy Award, Golden Globe, Emmy and BAFTA winner, <i>Love Actually</i>, Harry Potter, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>), Lily Cole (<i>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</i>, <i>Snow White and the Huntsman</i>, <i>St. Trinian's</i>), Douglas Booth (<i>Noah</i>, <i>Great Expectations</i>, <i>The Riot Club</i>), Jeremy Irvine (<i>Warhorse</i>, <i>The Railway Man</i>, <i>Now Is Good</i>), Eleanor Tomlinson (<i>Poldark</i>, <i>The Illusionist</i>, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>) and Ella Purnell (<i>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children</i>, <i>Never Let Me Go</i>, <i>Kick-Ass 2</i>), amongst others. </p>";
