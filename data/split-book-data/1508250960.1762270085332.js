In this milestone of Holocaust literature, Thomas Keneally, author of<i> The Book of Science and Antiquities</i> and <i>The Daughter of Mars</i>, uses the actual testimony of the Schindlerjuden — Schindler’s Jews — to brilliantly portray the courage and cunning of a good man in the midst of unspeakable evil. </p> <p>“Astounding.... In this case, the truth is far more powerful than anything the imagination could invent.” (<i>Newsweek</i>)</p>";
