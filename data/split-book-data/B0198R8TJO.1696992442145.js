window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The magnificent Richard Armitage (<i>Hamlet: King of Denmark: A Novel</i>) performs <i>The Chimes</i> by Charles Dickens. </p> <p>This classic story is the second in a series of five Christmas books Dickens was commissioned to write - beginning with <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. A haunting tale set on New Year's Eve, <i>The Chimes</i> tells the story of a poor porter named Trotty Veck who has become disheartened by the state of the world - until he is shown a series of fantastical visions that convince him of the good of humanity. Though much different from and certainly a bit darker than <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the moral message of <i>The Chimes</i> is equally poignant - touting the importance of compassion, goodwill, and the love of friends and family. </p> <p><i>The Chimes</i> was followed by <i>The Cricket on the Hearth</i>, <i>The Battle of Life</i>, and finally <i>The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain</i>. </p>";
