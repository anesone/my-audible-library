Particularly when you discover who's running the place.</p> <p>Charlie's life is going nowhere fast. A divorced substitute teacher living with his cat in a house his siblings want to sell, all he wants is to open a pub downtown, if only the bank will approve his loan.</p> <p>Then his long-lost uncle Jake dies and leaves his supervillain business (complete with island volcano lair) to Charlie.</p> <p>But becoming a supervillain isn't all giant laser death rays and lava pits.
