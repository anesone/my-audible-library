window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>First Meetings</i> is a collection of three novellas (plus the original \"Ender's Game\") that journey into the origins and the destiny of one Ender Wiggin. <p>\"The Polish Boy\", a novella written especially for this collection, begins in the years between the first two Bugger Wars when the Hegemony is desperate to recruit brilliant military commanders to repel the alien invasion. In John Paul Wiggin, the future father of Ender, they believe they may have found their man. Or boy.</p> <p>In \"Teacher's Pest\", also written especially for this collection, a brilliant but insufferably arrogant John Paul Wiggin, now an American university student, matches wits with an equally brilliant graduate student named Theresa Brown.</p> <p>It is many years since the end of the Bugger Wars in \"The Investment Counselor\". Ender's reputation as a hero and savior has suffered a horrible reversal. Banished from Earth and slandered as a mass murderer, 20-year-old Ender Wiggin wanders incognito form planet to planet as a fugitive, until a blackmailing tax inspector compromises his identity and threatens to expose Ender the Xenocide.</p> <p>Also here is the original landmark \"Ender's Game\", which first appeared in 1977.</p> <p><i>First Meetings</i> is Orson Scott Card at the height of his considerable powers, featuring his most compelling character.</p>";
