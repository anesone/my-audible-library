Whether recounting a tender love affair or a heroic triumph, Fry deftly finds resonance with our own modern minds and hearts. </p> <ul> <li>Each adventure is infused with Fry's distinctive voice and writing style.</li> <li>Connoisseurs of the Greek myths will appreciate this fresh-yet-reverential interpretation, while newcomers will feel welcome. </li> <li>Retellings brim with humor and emotion.</li> </ul> <p><b>\"Mostly Chiron saw in the child, and the young man he became, boundless courage, athleticism, intelligence, and ambition. He saw too lots of words beginning with 'self', which gave him pause. Self-belief, self-possession, self-righteousness, self-confidence, self-love. Perhaps these characteristics are as necessary to a hero as courage.\"</b></p> <p>In <i>Heroes</i>, Fry draws out the humor and pathos in both tender love affairs and heroic battles, and reveals each myth's relevance for our own time.</p>";
