window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The companion to the blockbuster best seller, <i>Getting Things Done</i>.</p> <p>Since its publication in 2001, <i>Getting Things Done</i> has become, as <i>Time</i> magazine put it, \"the defining self-help business book\" of the decade. Having inspired millions of readers/listeners around the world, it clearly spoke to an urgent need in an increasingly time-pressured society. Now, in the highly anticipated sequel <i>Making It All Work</i>, Allen unlocks the full power of his methods across the entire span of life and work. While <i>Getting Things Done</i> functioned as an essential tool kit, <i>Making It All Work</i> is an invaluable road map, providing both bearings to help you determine where you are in life and directions on how to get to where you want to go.</p>";
