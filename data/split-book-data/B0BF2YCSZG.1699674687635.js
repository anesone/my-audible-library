When he learns about the intensive Method acting process, he dives in deep—and immediately lands the lead role in a TV series about a brutal serial killer.</p> <p>But when the Method’s controversial techniques start to take over Brent’s psyche, the lines between real life and acting begin to blur dangerously. How far will Brent go to “become” the character?</p> <p>Starring Zachary Quinto (<i>Star Trek</i>, <i>Heroes</i>), Stephanie Beatriz (<i>Encanto</i>, <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i>), Lil Rel Howery (<i>Get Out</i>), and a full cast, <i>The Method</i> is pure James Patterson—a roller-coaster ride of lies, coverups, and dark deeds.</p>";
