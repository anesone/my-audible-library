window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When 007 goes to Harlem, it's not just for the jazz. This is the kingdom of Mr. Big, master of crime, voodoo baron, and partner in SMERSH's grim company of death. Those Mr. Big cannot possess he crushes - like his beautiful prisoner, Solitaire, and her would-be saviors James Bond and Agency man Felix Leiter. All three are marked out as victims in a trail of terror, treachery, and torture that leads from New York's underworld to the shark-infested island in the sun that Mr. Big calls his own. </p> <p>This audiobook includes an exclusive bonus interview with Rory Kinnear.</p> <p>Blackstone Audio, Inc.
