window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>After two </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best sellers, Nick Offerman returns with the subject for which he’s known best - his incredible real-life woodshop - in a program that includes five original songs. </b> </p> <p>Nestled among the glitz and glitter of Tinseltown is a testament to American elbow grease and an honest-to-god hard day’s work: Offerman Woodshop. Captained by hirsute woodworker, actor, comedian, and writer Nick Offerman, the shop produces not only fine handcrafted furniture, but also fun stuff - kazoos, baseball bats, ukuleles, moustache combs, even cedar strip canoes.</p> <p>Now Nick shares his experience of working at the woodshop with his ragtag crew of champions, tells you all about his passion for the discipline of woodworking, and teaches you how to make two of the woodshop’s most popular projects along the way: a Pop Top bottle opener and a three-legged stool. This audiobook will take you behind the scenes of the woodshop, both inspiring and teaching you to make your own projects while besotting you with the infectious spirit behind the shop and its complement of dusty wood-elves.</p> <p>While working on their projects, listeners can also enjoy exclusive original songs by Nick and his pal Jeff Tweedy - “Music to Sand By”, “American White Oak”, “Raising the Grain”, “The Lazy Carpenter”, and the title track, “Good Clean Fun”.</p> <p><i>Good Clean Fun</i> also includes writings by Nick, humorous essays, odes to his own woodworking heroes, insights into the ethos of woodworking in modern America, and other assorted tomfoolery, all imbued with Nick Offerman’s brand of bucolic yet worldly wisdom. </p> <p><b>*Includes a Bonus PDF with Drawings, Visuals, and Original Song Lyrics.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
