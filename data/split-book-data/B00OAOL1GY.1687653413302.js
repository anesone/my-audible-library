window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Seven centuries in the future, the sport of American football has never been bigger, never been faster, never been more lethal. Trillions of fans from all over the galaxy watch six unique races battle in contests so violent that deaths are part of the stat sheet. Star quarterback Quentin Barnes has led his beloved Ionath Krakens to glory on the gridiron and become the most-recognized individual in history, but it is off the field where his world crumbles around him. Over four seasons with Ionath, he's picked up powerful enemies, one of which drove his sister into the Portath Cloud, a place from which no ship returns. Because his enemies include his team owner - a possessive crime lord who treats players like property - and the ruling government that controls the shipping lanes, Quentin and his friends must hide from the media spotlight as they search for a way to rescue his sister. </p> <p>Set against the backdrop of a professional American football franchise seven centuries in the future, the Galactic Football League puts huge humans on the field with five alien races to create a game that is faster, stronger, and deadlier than anything we know today. Quarterback Quentin Barnes has grown from a racist, small-town standout into a proven leader, a uniter of peoples, and the Galaxy's most-famous athlete. Willing to do anything for his team, his Ionath Krakens have bound together through shared sacrifice, tragedy, devastating losses and thrilling victories.The GFL series melds star-spanning scifi, brutal crime fiction, and intense sports action into a smash-mouth extravaganza unlike anything you've read before.</p>";
