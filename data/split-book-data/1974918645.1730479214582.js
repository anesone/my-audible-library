But they were bored and restless and, looking for something interesting to do, thought they'd give Jumanji a try. Little did they know when they unfolded its ordinary-looking playing board that they were about to be plunged into the most exciting and bizarre adventure of their lives.</p> <p>Since its original publication, <i>Jumanji</i> has been honored with many awards, including the Caldecott Medal and a National Book Award nomination, and, in 1996, the surreal story was adapted for the big screen, followed by a 2017 sequel.</p>";
