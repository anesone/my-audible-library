window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What’s in a label? Are we the product of our upbringing or do we have a natural propensity towards good or evil? The eternal question of nature vs nurture is at the centre of Dr Diane Buckley’s world. A talented freelance forensic psychologist who has never quite found the key to engaging with people on a casual level, she is drafted in to examine a grisly murder – a body found in a children’s playground. </p> <p>The murder carries all hallmarks of one of her most famous incarcerated clients, ‘The Playground Killer’ (aka Alfred Dinklage) – namely the location of the body and the tongue being ‘forked’ like a snake with scissors. Buckley has a race against time to unpick the facts and delve into Dinklage’s often manipulative, complicated mind to understand his past to understand the present events – whilst striving to prevent further murders...as someone out there will stop at nothing to complete what they see as Dinklage’s work.</p> <p>Featuring: Kathryn Anderson, Shaun Aylward, Rob James, Collier, Angela Griffin, Lara Hutchinson, Christopher John-Slater, Katherine Kelly, Simon Kent, Damian Lynch, Will Mellor, Gray O'Brien, Bhasker Patel, Jeremy Swift and Tom Turgoose. </p> <p><b>Please note this contains violence and adult content and language. </b></p>";
