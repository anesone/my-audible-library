window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Growing up is hard enough without the added pressure of a hiccup in the fabric of space-time.</p> <p>Wally Roux is a teenage genius with a big imagination and a big heart, who just moved to Savannah, GA, from Maine with his mom, who adopted him when he was an infant. In this charming and sweet solo performance, Wally investigates what is causing a number of strange events and occurrences. He explores and gets lost within space-time - an infinite, indefinable, and mysterious void that you can’t see but when you slice into it you can feel it.</p> <p>Part science fiction and part coming-of-age story, <i>Wally Roux</i> follows one boy’s journey of self-discovery and self-identity.</p> <p>Playwright Nick Carr was awarded a commission through the Audible Emerging Playwrights Fund, an initiative dedicated to developing innovative original plays driven by language and voice.
