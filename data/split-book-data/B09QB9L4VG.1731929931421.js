His air of dignity, his sonorous voice, and the knowing wit he brought to each role continue to captivate audiences today.<br> <br> But Rickman’s ability to breathe life into projects wasn't confined to just his performances. As you'll find, Rickman's diaries detail the extraordinary and the ordinary, flitting between worldly and witty and gossipy, while remaining utterly candid throughout. He takes us inside his home, on trips with friends across the globe, and on the sets of films and plays ranging from <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, to Noël Coward's <i>Private Lives</i>, to the final film he directed, <i>A Little Chaos</i>.<br> <br> Running from 1993 to his death in 2016, the diaries provide singular insight into Rickman's public and private life. Reading them is like listening to Rickman chatting to a close companion. Meet Rickman the consummate professional actor, but also the friend, the traveler, the fan, the director, the enthusiast; in short, the man beyond the icon.<br> <br> <i>Madly, Deeply</i> features a photo insert, a foreword by Emma Thompson, and an afterword by Rima Horton.<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt and Company.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
