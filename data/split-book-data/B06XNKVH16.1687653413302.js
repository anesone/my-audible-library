window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and two-time National Book Award winner Robert A. Caro: a short, penetrating reflection on the evolution and workings of political power - for good and for ill.</b> </p> <p> In <i>On Power</i>, an Audible exclusive, the legendary historian Robert A. Caro reflects on what drew him as a young journalist to study political power and what his half century of reporting on New York City urban planner Robert Moses and President Lyndon Johnson has taught him about the inner workings of government and democracy. </p> <p>Adapted by the author from two recent speeches and filled with thoughtful lessons and personal moments, <i>On Power</i> goes behind the scenes in the author's decades-long quest to understand how power works, often in ways he could have never imagined. </p> <p>Listening to <i>On Power</i>, narrated with emotion and humor by Caro in his unmistakable New York accent, is like having a private audience with the author often hailed as our greatest living historian. Longtime fans of Caro's books, as well as those seeking a more personal introduction to his life and work, will be treated to his trademark wit and revelatory insight. </p> <p>But more than anything, <i>On Power</i> is a timely reminder for those who want to better understand how power and government work. </p> <p>In Caro's words: \"Why political power? Because it shapes all of our lives. It shapes your life in ways that you might never think about. Every time a young man goes to college on a federal education bill passed by Lyndon Johnson, that's political power. And so is a young man dying in Vietnam. Every time an elderly person is able to afford an MRI, that's Medicare. That's political power. It affects your life in all sorts of ways. My books are an attempt to explain this power.... Because the more America understands about political power, the better informed our votes will be, and then, hopefully, the better our democracy should be.\" </p>";
