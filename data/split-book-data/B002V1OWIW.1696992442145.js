window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>By the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Bone Clocks </i></b></p> <p><b>Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize</b></p> <p>A postmodern visionary and one of the leading voices in 21st-century fiction, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian love of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending, philosophical, and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profound as it is playful. In this groundbreaking novel, an influential favorite among a new generation of writers, Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.</p> <p><i>Cloud Atlas</i> begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite.... Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter.... From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life.... And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neo-capitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a post-apocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.</p> <p>But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.</p> <p>As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, <i>Cloud Atlas</i> is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult-classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.</p> <p><b>List of readers:</b></p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing</i>, read by Scott Brick</li> <li><i>Letters from Zedelghem</i>, read by Richard Matthews</li> <li><i>Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery</i>, read by Cassandra Campbell</li> <li><i>The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish</i>, read by John Lee</li> <li><i>An Orison of Sonmi-451</i>, read by Kim Mai Guest</li> <li><i>Sloosha’s Crossin’ an’ Ev’rythin’ After</i>, read by Kirby Heyborne&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul>";
